2/16 Meeting
-------------

Let's brainstorm! Make sure to note your UNI unambiguously next to every edit you make to this readme (ex. cl3425).

cl3425: Maybe basic, but from globalFloodsRecord data, plotting disproportionality of deaths given magnitude (which is log of severity*duration*area affected) on a map using the RgoogleMap package we saw in class. Also, doing the same thing with people displaced. This visualizes global disparities between regions and countries within regions with respect to how equipped they are to handle similarly "bad" floods.
