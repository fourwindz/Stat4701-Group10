2/16 Meeting
-------------

Let's brainstorm! Make sure to note your UNI unambiguously next to every edit you make to this readme (ex. cl3425).

cl3425: Maybe basic, but from globalFloodsRecord data, plotting disproportionality of deaths given magnitude (which is log of severity*duration*area affected) on a map using the RgoogleMap package we saw in class. Also, doing the same thing with people displaced. This visualizes global disparities between regions and countries within regions with respect to how equipped they are to handle similarly "bad" floods.

jcc2267: I really like the idea of seeing how global disparity affects flood impact. Would be good to tie this to global warming, I assume there is an increase in flood severity/quantity over time due to global warming and should be straight forward to plot:

jcc2267: Analysis technique - here are some random web links for methodology for analyzing Geopotential height. I don't understand any of them:

The last paper (Richman1986.pdf) seems the most useful. Looks like there are three standard mathematical techniques for analyzing geopotential height: "empirical orthogonal functions (EOFs) , principal components (PCs) [same as PCA I think] and common factor analysis (CFA)". We ought to do a basic analysis using one or more of these techniques.

This site is cool: http://www.esrl.noaa.gov/psd/enso/impacts/
You can input the same months for which we have data and plot the same chart - useful for validating we are visualizing correctly. And then display side by side an chart of El Nino for that year. Not sure what this has to do with anything but it looks cool :)
