The police, the Fire Department and self-defense forces, using helicopters and boats, had rescued more than 100 people there by 5 p.m. on Friday, NHK reported..."".September 10, 2015: ""Japanese floods stretch limits of elaborate water networks.
The sudden inundation of a city north of Tokyo this week when a river swollen by torrential rains broke through flood embankments was a relatively rare occurrence in Japan, a country with one of the world's most elaborate water-control systems. Here is a look at the disaster and its implications: A section of an embankment along the Kinugawa River, a tributary of one of the major rivers in the Tokyo region, the Tone, gave way Thursday, allowing the water to surge into the surrounding valley. Many residents who had not heeded warnings to flee were stranded atop roofs and vehicles as the waters rose around them. Authorities said 22 people were missing. WHY DID THE RIVER FLOOD
For one, a lot of rain. Government data show that the amount of water entering the river system due to the unusually heavy rainfall caused four upstream dams to reach capacity in only a few hours, limiting their effectiveness for flood control.The relatively steep grade and narrow river bed in the worst-hit city of Joso also raised the risk of flooding. A flood hazard map for Joso shows risks of flooding up to three stories high in much of the valley. The levees along the Kinugawa were due to be reinforced, but work hadn't begun yet.EVACUATION DELAYS. While tens of thousands of people were instructed to evacuate, many more received only a ""recommendation"" to leave and many stayed put. That's typical. In Japan, many ignore evacuation warnings, other than the elderly and the infirm, who are not able to escape quickly. HISTORICAL FACTORS. The name ""Kinugawa"" means ""river of an angry demon."" It has flooded repeatedly over the centuries. In 1938 more than 300 people died in a flood brought on by a typhoon. Japan's rulers ordered a change to the river's course in the 17th century as part of a larger project to divert the Tone River away from Tokyo Bay and further east, directly into the Pacific.? 2015 The Associated Press.

If not lost entirely, their properties will be severely damaged, and they face the added challenge of keeping their families healthy in far from sanitary conditions.Guillermo has pitched his tent on the mud a few metres away from his inundated house, on higher ground next to the railroad. He is living in it with his two oldest children while they wait for his wife and little baby to return. They are staying at a shelter until it dries up and its safe for them to come back, he explains.He smiles bitterly as he tells IRIN how his television was washed away. What the water doesnt steal, stray hands will, goes the oft-heard expression during these floods. Guillermo, like many others, is leaving nothing to chance and is staying put so nothing else is lost.The government and NGOs are hard at work trying to get peoples lives back on track. Local official Andrea Bozzini tells IRIN that every family has been given a special kit to help them start the clean-up process. The government will also continue to distribute meals, drinking water, blankets and other basic necessities in the coming days, she says.By Sunday morning only 68 of the 500 or so evacuees remain in the two official shelters in Mercedes. They are all women and children planning to return after lunch to celebrate the end of Argentinas Childrens Day in their own homes.The next weeks and months will not be easy for many, especially in the poorer neighbourhoods that suffered the most damage. Here, people with limited means will struggle to recover any time soon. I cannot afford another week off work, says Hernán. The construction worker is forlorn. He had been about to build a new more robust house for his family, but all his materials, like his home, were washed away in the flood.The government has announced an increase in pensions and welfare payments for those affected, as well as extra tax credits and exemptions. This is something at least, but for those who have lost everything, it is little recompense.In early August, more rain fell in just two days in the provinces of Buenos Aires and Santa Fe than normally falls in an entire month. Worst-hit were the cities of Luján, Mercedes, Salto, Lobos, Areco and Arrecifes. Floodwaters in the middle of town reached a height of 1.8 metres in some cases. At least three people died, more than 10,000 were evacuated and 20,000 affected.More than 10,000 people were evacuated from the province
Mercedes suffered its worst flooding since 1985. The civil defense authority received its first emergency calls as dawn broke on 10 August. By eight o¡¯clock in the morning, there had been ""re than 100 requests for assistance. It was left to volunteer firefighters to rescue those trapped by the rapidly rising water. Strong currents made it impossible to use anything else but motorised boats. ¡°People know what to do when we arrive. They have learnt from previous catastrophes,¡± Alfredo Guti¨¦rrez, the deputy head of the firefighters, tells IRIN ironically.
Another firefighter, Sebasti¨¢n Cossi, recalls how difficult it was to reach those who had actually dialled in for help because the rescue teams kept finding other people in need along the way. After 15 hours, the teams had rescued some 200 people.

"July 20, 2015: ""Meteorologist Ari Sarsalari takes a look at some of the top craziest things that happened as a result of the flooding in parts of California in mid July. When flash flooding hit, a Southern California bridge failed, after storm water eroded away the land on which the bridge was anchored. The scary situation developed late Sunday in the deserts east of Palm Springs, California, where the eastbound lanes of Interstate 10 were washed away by floodwaters near the town of Desert Center, according to the California Highway Patrol. At least one person was transported to a Palm Springs hospital after being trapped in a vehicle during the incident. Officials were concerned that the westbound lanes may have been undermined by the flooding, and the freeway remains closed.""Interstate 10 is closed completely and indefinitely,"" Terri Kasinga, spokeswoman for the California Department of Transportation, told the Associated Press Monday morning.In 2014, the National Bridge Inventory listed the eastbound lanes of the Tex Wash Bridge as ""functionally obsolete,"" according to a Desert Sun report. The bridge was built in 1967 and was considered ""no longer adequate for its task, though it was not listed as having known structural problems that needed to be fixed,"" the report added. The westbound bridge, built the same year, was labeled ""not deficient,"" the Desert Sun also found.One of the proposed detour routes, State Route 78, was also closed from Brawley to Palo Verde when it was flooded a short time later, damaging the eastbound lanes. Arizona officials advised residents to use Interstate 8 to get to southern California's major coastal cities.Nine inspectors fanned out Throughout the day Monday, nine state inspectors fanned out to check all 44 bridges along a 20-mile stretch of I-10 after a second bridge showed signs of damage following the storm Sunday, according to Caltrans. They also planned to inspect bridges across the large swath of Southern California where the remnants of a tropical storm dumped unusual July deluges, the AP reported.""This is a fascinating situation on so many levels. Against a backdrop of climate change, with the global atmosphere setting heat records month after month, we have an El Ni?o warming the waters of the tropical eastern Pacific.

Many more are thought to be missing.

June usually sees the start of Nepals monsoon. Nearly 130 mm of rain fell in the Taplejung between 10 and 11 June 2015, according to the Meteorological Forecasting Division of the Government of Nepal. The heavy rain has caused the Mewa and Tamor rivers to burst their banks and triggered landslides.

Local media say one landslide in Taplejung has affected the several villages, including Liwang, Thokling, Thinglabu and Lingket VDCs in Taplejung district.

The area is remote, and attempts by rescue and relief operations teams to reach the affected area have been hampered by poor weather.

Although Taplejung was not severely affected by the devastating earthquake of April, research after the quake found that many slopes across Nepal remained unstable and vulnerable to landslides, and that the situation was likely to worsen with the onset of monsoon rains.

The threat of post-quake landslides in Nepal is so great that NASA is working on mapping potential locations. Last week, NASA announced that a team of international volunteers was working through satellite imagery of the earthquake-affected areas in Nepal to identify possible landslide locations.

May 2015 was the wettest month on record in Oklahoma and Texas, where huge amounts of rain fell across the Southern Plains. Since then the water has made its way downstream, swelling levels of the Red River in Louisiana.

Levels of the Red river at Shreveport have been at major flood stage since last week, and are expected to remain so for at least 3 or 4 more days. Hundreds of homes and businesses have been flooded, as have wide areas of farmland and several roads in Bossier and Caddo parishes.

With 86 per cent of the population living in rural areas and engaged in farming and livestock rearing, long-term watershed management infrastructures are urgently needed so that even intense flooding is less damaging than this year.In addition, the press release noted, WFP is currently participating in a joint rapid food security assessment ""in order to understand the latest needs on the ground and the required duration of the emergency response"" while also providing recommendations on the duration of the ongoing lean season food insecurity response which has already identified nearly 700,000 people in need of food assistance"" .February 8, 2015: ""Bangula ¡ª For those who have lost everything in southern Malawi's Chikwawa District, just getting the next meal is now the priority.""ife is unbearable here.

[This report does not necessarily reflect the views of the United Nations."" ]January 9, 2015: "" BY RICHARD DAVIES IN AFRICA, NEWS. Heavy rainfall in parts of south east Africa over the last 2 weeks has resulted in flooding in Zimbabwe, Malawi and Mozambique.As reported earlier this week, as many as 10 people have died in flooding in Zimbabwe. According to media reports, 6 people have been killed in Malawi and as many as 9 people have died as a result of recent severe weather in Mozambique. Heavy rainfall has also been reported in Madagascar and Zambia although no flooding has as yet been reported.Change in Monsoon  Rainfall 150% Higher Than NormalAccording to a report (pdf) on Africa Hazards Outlook by NOAAs Climate Prediction Center, the heavy rainfall is a result of a change of the southern Africa Monsoon. The report says:Since late December, the character of the southern Africa monsoon has shifted considerably, as several regions of southeastern Africa continue to experience a significant increase in rains and available ground moisture. This increase has helped both alleviate and completely offset seasonal moisture deficits associated with a poor/delayed start of the monsoon during November and December.The report goes on to say that areas of south east Africa have seen rainfall amounts 150% higher than normal.
During the last 30 days, analysis of rainfall anomaly tendency shows the greatest positive changes (>100mm) have occurred throughout southern Zambia, Zimbabwe, Malawi, Mozambique and western Madagascar. It is these areas that are now experiencing approximately 150 percent of their normal precipitation for the season.NOAA predicts further heavy rainfall over the coming days, and possibly for the rest of January. This makes the possibility of more flooding highly likely, in particular as river levels are already high.These torrential rains not only reportedly triggered flooding in central Zimbabwe during the last week, but are also expected to elevate the risk for downstream inundation along the Zambezi, Save, Buzi, Pungwe, and Limpopo Rivers in Mozambique.Cahora Bassa Dam Such heavy rainfall in this area invariably focuses attention on the Cahora Bassa dam. Mozambiques Disaster Management Technical Council (CTGC) say that the reservoir still has plenty of storage capacity, and so Hidroelectrica de Cahora Bassa (HCB), the company that operates the dam, is currently only discharging 2,500 cubic metres a second.
But if the current scenario persists, HCB may be obliged to increase the discharges in order to guarantee the safety and integrity of the dam itself. Increased discharges from Cahora Bassa will inevitably increase the threat of flooding on the lower Zambezi.A dambreach would prove disastrous for communities downstream of the dam. The flood wave would reach Tete (with a population of more than 150,000) just 10 hours after the breach.See the report by Marc Hartman of HKV Consultants for an animation of the potential flood resulting from a dambreach in the Cahora Bassa dam.Mozambique   Yesterday 134 mm of rain fell was recorded in 24 h""urs in Nampula, Mozambique. Severe weather has been affecting Nampula Province for the last 2 weeks and 9 people have been reported as killed in Nacala city. The deaths were thought to have been caused by lightning strikes and by the collapse of a wall during a thunderstorm.According to a statement made by Mozambique government¡¯s Disaster Management Technical Council (CTGC), around 2,500 houses have been damaged or destroyed in the floods and rainstorms since late December 2014. Almost 10,000 families have been affected, with Maputo province and city are thought to be some of the worst affected areas.
Zimbabwe    At least 10 people have died in the floods in Zimbabwe. The latest assessment from the Zimbabwe Red Cross says that over 160 houses have been destroyed. Other media reports says this total sh""ld be closer to 2,000. Assessment work is still being carried out by the Red cross and Zimbabwe authorities.

Adrian Horta said.Horta said he was able to steer his SUV alongside the car and pull the woman and her male companion out through a window on the road north of Hemet, a valley city surrounded by hills and mountains.""The mountain slide had come down and it was about 4 feet deep,"" he told KCBS-TV.A swift water rescue crew rescued 12 other motorists. Over the next several hours, rescuers pulled 26 more people from cars in the Hemet and San Jacinto areas, county fire spokesman Lucas Spelman said. Several cars and SUVs remained stuck in mud, some with only their roofs exposed.Residents of eight nearby homes were evacuated as a precaution, and numerous roads in the inland region were closed, Spelman said.South in San Diego County, morning floodwaters sent a mudflow 80 feet wide into roads in the Alpine area.The diminishing Pacific system brought three days of rain to California. There was some flooding and evacuations near hillsides stripped bare by wildfires, but the Los Angeles area avoided major damage despite some huge rainfall totals. An exceptional 14.5 inches has fallen since Tuesday at Yucaipa Ridge in the San Bernardino Mountains, the National Weather Service said.Most other parts of the state received 2 to 4 inches of rain.
The storm dropped snow in mountains key to the state's water supply and made signature waterfalls flow at Yosemite National Park, including the 2,425-foot Yosemite Falls that had slowed to a trickle in mid-July.But the needed soaking also caused problems: likely opening a pair of sinkholes in San Francisco, including a 20-by-30-foot chasm in a neighborhood, and flooding freeways in Sacramento.The San Francisco Bay Area reached or exceeded normal annual rainfall totals for the first time in years.Just before the storm arrived, the Sierra Nevada snowpack - which accounts for most of the state's water supply - was at just 24 percent of normal for this time of year. But snow was building rapidly with reports of 10 inches of snowfall at elevations of 8,000 feet.That good news was tempered by a stark reality: California needs many more such storms to alleviate a three-year drought."

We can't afford to rent an apartment' butcher's wife Lovi Barbosa 35 told AFP as she attempted to remove dirt from the floor of her home near a still swollen creek.She said she and her five children aged between two and 10 spent a sleepless night sat on the cold floor outside a tyre repair shop because the local school was already full of similarly displaced neighbors.Three weeks' worth of rain swamped the region on Friday state meteorologists said as the eye of the relatively weak storm brushed past the northern tip of the main island of Luzon more than 400 km away. The state weather service said Fung-Wong was forecast to hit Taiwan on Sunday.
Many of the areas hardest hit by floods such as Barbosa's neighbourhood are shantytowns illegally occupying the banks of rivers and other waterways.'Generally the floods have already subsided. People are starting to return to their homes' Alexander Pama executive director of the disaster council said Saturday.The bad weather left five people dead and one missing he told a news conference.The storm itself caused power outages across northern Luzon while rough seas left a small ferry off the central port of Cebu badly damaged on Friday Pama added.Navy rescuers along with nearby commercial ships retrieved 31 people from the stricken vessel Philippine Navy spokeswoman Commander Marineth Domingo told AFP.An average of 20 typhoons or major storms hit the Philippines each year killing hundreds and bringing misery to millions.Super Typhoon Haiyan bringing the strongest winds ever recorded on land left 7300 people dead or missing across the central Philippines in November last year.

"September 7, 2014: ""INUNDATION Sukhothai and Ayutthaya hit hard by floodsThe Sunday Nation September 7, 2014 1:00 amThe flood situation in Sukhothai and Ayutthaya remains critical with hundreds of homes inundated, while a flash flood hit Chiang Rai's Muang and Mae Sai districts yesterday morning.Meanwhile, ML Sukhumbhand Paribatra, who resumed as Bangkok governor after the Court of Election Appeals dismissed an election fraud charge against him, yesterday checked progress of the city's flood-prevention measures.In Sukhothai, which has five districts declared as flood disaster zones, the situation remained critical yesterday, especially in Sri Samrong and Muang districts. The Yom River, taking in northern run-off at 1,400 cubic metres per second, continued to rise, while a 100-metre section of a flood wall in tambon Pak Kwae in Muang district broke and many areas of this tambon were under two-metres of water. Troops on flat-bottom boats helped evacuate residents at risk in Sri Samrong to safer ground.The situation looked unlikely to improve this weekend, as the Meteorological Department said a strong monsoon trough covering the upper part of Thailand would remain there. Disaster Prevention and Mitigation Department chief Chatchai Phromloet said that the state had put flood-mitigation measures in place and he was confident the disastrous floods of 2010 would not be repeated this year. 
Many farmers in water-retention areas in Bang Ban district in Ayutthaya hastily harvested their rice paddy in a bid to prevent more flood damage by northern run-off, Tambon Bang Ban Mayor Chukiat Boonmee said. Farmer Phang Khunwan, 51, whose rice crop was not yet ripe, said he harvested the paddy out of fear that all would be lost. In Phachi and Uthai districts, villagers lamented that off-season rice paddy in flood-hit fields would be ruined if the situation didn't improve within five days.In Uttaradit's Tha Pla district, 80 homes and farmland near Huay Nam Mhan canal were flooded by forest run-off yesterday.Strong torrents destroyed a bridge, a spillway and brought down several power poles, which led to a blackout in six villages in tambon Nam Mhan. This prompted residents to prepare to evacuate, as it brought back memories of a flood in 2006 when the area was also hit by a landslide.In Angthong's Pa Moke district, flood-prone tambon Phong Pheng has again been inundated, affecting 3,000 villagers. A flood aid centre was opened yesterday, with some 200 police, Army and provincial administrators, 20 flat-bottom boats, and four Humvees deployed to assist people hit by the flood.Up North, residents and business owners in Chiang Rai's Mae Sai district moved belongings to higher ground after parts of the Thai-Myanmar border, especially the Tambon Mae Sai municipality, was hit by a 30cm flood. A flash flood also caused inundation in many parts of Muang district.In Bangkok, BMA Department of Drainage and Sewerage director Adisak Khantee reported to Sukhumbhand that the city would have heavy rain in several areas over the weekend, while seasonal seawater inflows were expected at the end of the month. Adisak said the city had prepared to handle the situation with 166 water pump stations, 217 sluice gates, and seven drainage tunnels. He said city workers had cleared almost 100 per cent of waterways and sewage pipes. A total of 520 water pumps were installed at flood-prone spots, while staff at relevant facilities were on alert.Sukhumbhand said the situation was not worrisome because the Bhumibol, Sirikit and Pa Sak Jolasid dams were still at 30-40 per cent capacity. However, he urged Adisak's office to monitor the rainfall in order to handle any flooding in a timely manner. He said the city, being more equipped than the Highway Department and the Rural Roads Department, had received the National Council for Peace and Order's permission to handle Bangkok's flood-hit roads. Sukhumbhand later inspected the Bang Sue tunnel, which is under construction and slated for completion in September 2016. He said the Bt2.4 billion, 5.4m-wide tunnel, which can drain water into the Chao Phraya River at 60 cubic metres per second, would help prevent flooding in Chatuchak, Bang Sue, Huai Khwang, Ratchathewi, Phaya Thai and Lat Phrao.The Royal Irrigation Department urged residents in low-lying areas near the Chao Phraya who are outside flood barriers, to brace for flooding due to rising water levels.

The Emergency Operations Committee (COE) in Dominican Republic have said that almost 4,000 people have been displaced by recent flooding in the country after several days of heavy rainfall. One person has been reported as missing after he was swept away by flood water in Hato Mayor province.

The floods have damaged over 600 houses and left several communities cut off. Bridges, roads and power lines have also been damaged. The worst affected areas have been the eastern parts of the country, in particular the provinces of San Pedro de Macoris, El Seibo and Hato Mayo.

No relief centres or temporary accommodation have been set up for the displaced, who are all currently being housed by relatives or neighbours.

High rainfall levels have led to the overflowing of several rivers, including the Ozama and Soco. According to WMO, in a 24 hour period between 23 and 24 August 2014, 128 mm of rain fell in La Romana, Dominican Republic.

The heavy rain is a result of Tropical Cyclone Cristobal in the Caribbean which has affected other countries since 23 August, and is headed for the Bahamas, although has since weakened and been downgraded to a tropical storm.

Three people are reported to have died in flooding in Saint-Marc, Haiti. Flooding was also reported in Turks and Caicos islands.

The flood situation in Jammu and Kashmir continues after 3 days of heavy rain fell in the region. Rescue teams are working to help move those in vulnerable areas to higher ground.

The death toll has doubled since yesterday (see our original report here) and local reports now say that as many as 12 people have been killed in floods or landslides since 02 September 2014.

River levels are now extremely high and are posing a considerable flood threat for many communities. The River Jhelum is flowing four feet above the danger mark in Srinagar. Over 50 mm of rain fell in 24 hours between 03 ad 04 September in Srinagar. Moderate to heavy rain is expected to continue for at least 48 hours.

SRINAGAR, India (AP) -- A bus carrying more than 50 wedding guests was swept away Thursday by a flooded stream in the Indian-held portion of Kashmir and all but three of the passengers were missing, officials said.

Police officer Rajesh Kumar said the three swam to safety and told rescuers that about 50 others were trapped in the bus.

Rescuers were searching for the bus but had not been able to locate it in the gushing waters. New landslides and heavy rains blocked access to the area, Kumar said.

Officials earlier said the bus was carrying about 70 people. ""There is a lot of confusion,"" Kumar said.

The Press Trust of India news agency said the bride and bridegroom were among the missing people who were returning home from a wedding ceremony in a village in the Rajouri region, about 180 kilometers (110 miles) southwest of Srinagar, the main city in the Indian-held portion of Kashmir.

The region's wedding season has been disrupted by heavy rains and the worst floods in 22 years, and many ceremonies have been postponed.

At least 18 people have died in the past two days, and authorities on Thursday closed schools and stopped train services in the Kashmir valley. Meteorologists said the heavy rains were likely to continue for another two days.

Police officer Imtiyaz Hussain said the 18 victims were swept away by floodwaters or buried by mud from mountain slopes - 14 in the Jammu region and four in the Kashmir valley. They included a paramilitary officer whose bunker collapsed on him.

Soldiers and rescue workers used boats to move thousands of people to higher ground. At least 100 villages across the Kashmir valley were flooded by overflowing lakes and rivers, including the Jhelum river, which was up to 1.5 meters (4 feet) above its danger level, officials said.

Landslides and floods are common in India during the monsoon season, which runs from June through September.

Parts of Srinagar were also flooded. In Bemina, a large neighborhood, thousands of residents waded through ankle-high water that entered their homes.

Authorities evacuated 5,000 people from the neighborhood and 100 others were believed to be stranded there.

Kashmir is divided between India and Pakistan and claimed by both. They have fought three wars, two of them over control of Kashmir, since winning independence from Britain in 1947.  ....Flood alert sounded in Srinagar as Jhelum swells

"DHAKA, 2 September 2014 (IRIN) - Floods triggered by two weeks of intense rain have affected two million people in northern Bangladesh and left up to half a million homeless. While the country¡¯s disaster response capacity has been enhanced in recent years, experts argue that with people displaced and crops destroyed the flooding is testing response mechanisms.

""mprovement has been made in regard to flood forecasting system but there is still lack of coordination among government agencies,"" Mahbuba Nasreen, director of the Institute of Disaster Management and Vulnerability Studies at Dhaka University, told IRIN. 

A 31 August situation report by the Ministry of Disaster Management and Relief said 17 of the country¡¯s 64 districts have been affected. Six of these districts are expected to experience rising water levels this week, and Dhaka, the capital and home to 15 million people, may see flooding as well.

NGOs estimate that the floods have left 500,000 homeless and, according to the UN World Food Programme (WFP), ¡°others, who have nowhere else to go, have remained in their flooded homes.¡±

Nasreen explained that part of the remaining weakness is due to Bangladesh¡¯s Water Development Board being responsible for building and repairing embankments, which protect against floods, while the Ministry of Disaster Management and Relief is responsible for reacting to disasters. This, she argued, results in lack of coordination between the two agencies.

""organization should look after the whole thing,"" she said. ""There are still lots of things to do to improve [the] country's disaster response.""

Immediate relief

According to government figures, 17 people have died due to drowning in the floods, and there have been 506 cases of pneumonia, 1,850 cases of diarrhoea and 540 cases of skin infections.

Residents in the affected districts told IRIN they were worried both about the short- and long-term consequences of the flooding as they struggled to find dry ground and watched their crops get washed away.

Abdul Mannan, a father of four and farmer in Pikan Village in Rangpur District, said: Most of my lands are being inundated. I dont know how can I manage basic things for my family in the coming days.

Christa Räder, WFP representative in Bangladesh, told IRIN the agencies assistance has focused on the distribution of nutritious biscuits, which do not require cooking. Since 24 August WFP has reached more than 50,000 people with nutritious biscuits in the flood- and river erosion-affected districts of the north, she said, explaining that many people have fled their flood-hit homes and are now living on higher ground or embankments, without stoves or cooking utensils.

This immediate food assistance is important as in the initial period after a flood people have no means to cook and depend on our ready-to-eat assistance, she said, adding: There are many more displaced people in the flood-affected areas who have not yet received immediate assistance.

Fewer deaths

Some indicators suggest Bangladeshs disaster response capacity has improved in recent years. While 17 people have died in this year¡¯s floods, a similar round of flooding in 2007 killed 1,110 people, a flood in 1998 killed 1,050, and a flood in 1988 killed 2,379.

The government has modernized its Flood Forecasting and Warning Centre, which now gives up-to-date flood forecasting five days in advance (as opposed to an earlier threshold of three days), as well as information online and to people who call in.

Long-term concerns

Rezaul Karim Chowdhury, executive direct of the NGO Coast Trust, told IRIN the government¡¯s response must also consider long-term relief measures.

The DMD is running 146 relief camps to provide food and shelter to around 33,200 rescued and displaced persons. The number of people staying at the camps is decreasing as many have left to go to their relatives' places.

Seeing the trend of heavy rainfall in the Nepal catchment areas of several rivers flowing through Bihar, the Central Flood Control Room of the state Water Resources Department has issued a communique to all its chief engineers to keep their subordinates on alert and conduct intensive patrolling on the river embankments to negate any chance of breach.

Meanwhile, Chief Minister Jitan Ram Manjhi did an aerial survey of Nalanda district and held a meeting with Ministers, MLAs and senior officials at International Convention Centre in Rajgir over the flood situation.

So much so that that at least 100 villages have been flooded in the last 24 hours, according to Bihar¡¯s Disaster Management Department. Crops, transport and communication infrastructure have also been affected. Teams from India¡¯s National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) are working in the area in attempts to ensure safety. Currently the numbers of those who have moved from their homes to safer ground remain in the hundreds. Over 40,000 people were evacuated from their homes after the Nepal landslide earlier in August. The landslide had blocked the Sunkoshi river, raising fears that Bihar would be inundated once the blockage had been removed.

In the northern part of the state, levels of the major rivers, including Kosi, Gandak, Kamla Balan and Bagmati are all extremely high.

In some parts of the rivers have overflowed and inundated nearby villages in 9 districts. The affected districts include: Bagha, Gopalganj, Madhubani, Sitamarhi, Supaul, Saharsa, Khagaria, Darbhanga and Madhepura.

The flood hit provinces include Fujian, Jiangxi, Hunan, Guangdong, Sichuan and Guangxi Zhuang Region, as well as Guizhou."
"August 19, 2015; While the rest of the country was busy celebrating Janmashtmi and getting over the hangover of the 68th Independence Day celebrations, lakhs of people marooned in eastern UP villages were struggling and praying just to stay alive in the face of a ravaging onslaught of swirling waters from rivers flowing dangerously above their red (danger) marks.

Over a thousand villages are flooded in nine districts of east UP. As many as 31 people have died and about half a million are affected by the floods aggravated by the unannounced release of waters from Nepal. The worst-hit district in UP is Bahraich, which is cheek by jowl with Nepal. Over 200 villages are virtually submerged under water and lakhs have been displaced in this remote eastern UP district which has recorded the maximum number of deaths (15) due to floods. Official sources say Army helicopters have been dropping food packets in the affected villages there.

What is worse is that electricity supply to this vast swathe of eastern UP has been cut off so that no one gets electrocuted. If that was not bad enough, things are expected to get worse with the Met officials predicting heavy rainfall in UP's eastern parts in the coming days.

Shravasti, Balrampur, Sitapur, Lakhimpur Kheri, Gonda, Barabanki, Faizabad and Azamgarh are the other districts in the state that have been badly affected by the floods.

""We are doing our best to reach relief to the affected people,"" UP chief secretary Alok Ranjan told dna. He said at least six lakh hectares of land had been affected and over 600 houses had been washed away. So far, 17,000 villagers have been rescued and efforts are on to reach remote areas surrounded by flood waters, he added. The state government has released Rs51 crore as relief for the flash flood-hit districts, Ranjan informed.

The Centre has issued an ""unprecedented flood situation"" warning for the Rapti, which is flowing above the danger mark in eastern UP. It threads through densely populated parts of the state.

Chief revenue officer, Bahraich, Uday Shankar described the floods as unprecedented. ""This is after 20 years that such floods are being seen in this district. The sudden release of water from Nepal gave no time to the villagers to prepare for evacuation. Many link roads and the main road connecting Bahraich to Shravasti are cut off. Most of the area is flooded due to the bloated Saryu,"" he said.

TV visuals show cattle, children and elders standing on embankments, swimming through flooded villages, marooned atop their submerged houses or being ferried by boats along with their bedding and gunny bags of wheat and grass.

A senior irrigation department official said despite relief work on a war-footing 60 villages of Bahraich were still inaccessible. Helicopters have been dropping food packets there, he said.

In Barabanki, the Ghaghra is dangerously on the rise. District magistrate Yogeshwar Ram Mishra said though the situation here was not as bad as in Bahraich, as many as 70 more villages here were affected on Sunday and 25 of them have completely been evacuated, with people living in tents at embankments with their families and cattle. ""We are trying to evacuate villages and no deaths have occurred here till now,"" he said.

UP chief secretary blames Nepal
UP chief secretary Alok Ranjan has squarely blamed Nepal for the flash floods in eastern UP districts. ""Rivers like Rapti and Ghaghra were over flowing because of excess release of water from Nepal. While the Rapti was over flowing because authorities in Bhalubang, Bhairahwa and Kusum barrages in Nepal released excess water, the Ghagra has swollen due to release of flood waters from Chisapani barrage in Nepal. The other terai rivers in spate are Saryu and Sharda,"" he told dna on Monday.
Ranjan said engineers of the irrigation department were monitoring the situation round the clock lest more fresh areas were inundated. The Nepal authorities never informed their UP counterparts in advance, he said, adding, ""this could have given us some time to evacuate the villagers in time.""
He said para-military forces had been pushed into service and Army had been asked to stand by. The UP government has called in Army choppers for rescue work while a team of NDRF has been rushed from Varanasi to Bahraich. Around 5,000 people were rescued by the PAC and NDRF teams, Ranjan said.
""Medical teams have been rushed to Bahraich while PAC has deployed 19 motorboats and 378 boats to rescue the people,"" he said21 Killed in Floods in Uttar Pradesh, India, Posted by Richard Davies on August 17, 2014, At least 21 people have died and 300,000 affected after 2 major rivers in Uttar Pradesh burst their banks.
River levels have increased after several days of heavy rain in the state and in the rivers¡¯ catchment areas in Nepal. At least 65 people have died in floods in Nepal over the last few days. After days of torrential rain in Nepal, it was inevitable that authorities there would need to open barrages to release excess water and ease pressure on dams. This has since increased river levels in Uttar Pradesh.

According to the Times of India the barrages at Bhalubang, Bhairahwa and Kusum, as well as Chisapani, were opened some time between 15 and 16 August 2014.

River levels in Uttar Pradesh were already swollen by the heavy rainfall in the catchment area of the Himalayas. Since openi"
"August 19, 2014: KATMANDU, Nepal   Authorities in Nepal and neighboring India sent food, medical supplies and tents Monday to areas where monsoon floods have displaced thousands of people and killed at least 180 in recent days.

Four helicopters with relief supplies and medical workers were sent to cut-off villages in western Nepal, Jhanka Nath Dhakal of the National Emergency Operation Center said. Most roads into the area are submerged or damaged by flooding, preventing vehicles from passing.

Thousands of people are without shelter in 10 flooded districts, and local officials on Monday distributed rice and lentils and cooking pots to people who lost their homes. The area is mainly farmland where the poor live in mud and straw huts that wash away easily.

At least 100 people have died in Nepal since Thursday, and at least 84 have died in neighboring India due to torrential rains or overflowing rivers after dams were opened in Nepal, authorities said.

In northern India, at least 50 people have died in Uttarakhand state, many of them washed away as rivers overflowed, submerging villages and fields. Officials in neighboring Uttar Pradesh state reported 10 more deaths overnight, pushing its toll to 34.

People in the worst-affected villages were being evacuated to relief camps set up in government and school buildings, said Alok Ranjan, a government official in Uttar Pradesh.

State authorities said paramilitary soldiers in some 400 boats were helping to evacuate people from their homes after entire villages were marooned in northern Uttar Pradesh.

Several rivers overflowed after water was released from dams in Nepal, Ranjan said.

Nepal's Prime Minister Sushil Koirala appealed to both and domestic and foreign agencies to help flood victims there. The main opposition party in Parliament, the Communist Party of Nepal-Maoist, disrupted parliamentary proceedings and demanded that the government declare a national emergency.

Dhakal said the government was trying to send medical teams and supplies to prevent diseases such as cholera that can follow flooding. They are also distributing tents and plastic sheets to make temporary shelters, utensils to cook food and clothes for those who lost their belongings.

The June-September monsoon season often bring flooding to Nepal and neighboring India. The rains caused a landslide earlier this month that covered an entire village near Katmandu, killing 156 people.

Odisha Update:

3 bodies have been found in Bargarh district, Odisha. The bodies were in a car that was swept away in flood waters on Monday 21 July 2014. It is thought the driver was attempting to cross a bridge over the swollen Uttali river. There is also thought to have been a fourth passenger, although authorites are yet to recover a body.

The recovery of the 3 bodies brings the death toll of the recnet floods in Odisha to 6.

Original Report from 23 July 2014

Monsoon rain has brought deadly floods the central and eastern parts of India over the last few days, killing at least 5 people with 2 still missing.

Two deaths occurred in the state of Chhattisgarh, where around 300 villages have been flooded. Three people died in flooding in the neighbouring state of Odisha after rivers overflowed.

Chhattisgarh

Two days of heavy rain in the state of Chhattisgarh has left over 300 villages under water. Over 350mm of rain fell in just 48 hours, bringing the July total to 422.5mm. Further rainfall has been forecast for the state.

The worst affected districts are Gariyaband, Mahasamund, Kanker and Bastar. Two people have died as a result of the flooding, one in Mahasamund and another in Kanker where the Kotri river overflowed. Other rivers, including Sodur, Pari, Jonk, Tale, Indravati and Doodh have also burst their banks.

Odisha

Local media reports claim around 200 villages have suffered from flooding in the state of Odisha over the last few days, affecting over 50,000 people. Four days of heavy monsoon rain between 18 and 22 July 2014 increased rivers to danger levels and many have burst their banks. Jharsuguda saw 103mm of rain in 24 hours on 21 July. The worst affected areas are the districts of Jajpur, Keonjhar, Kalahandi and Bhadrak.

Odisha Disaster Rapid Action Force (ODRAF) and National Disaster Response Force have evacuated 15,000 people from the districts of Jaipur, Keonjhar and Bhadrak. Three people died in the floods, and another 2 are still missing in Kaptipada in Mayurbhanj district.

The most recent indications are that flood water in some areas has started to recede. Earlier today Special Relief Commissioner (SRC) said that levels of major rivers including Mahanadi, Kushabhadra, Baitarani, Budhabalang, Subarnarekha and Vansdhara were now below danger level. Levels of the Devi, Brahmani, Subarnarekha, Vansadhara and Rusikulya rivers are still above flood stage however.


The unfortunate location of Odisha leaves it vulnerable to floods from both tidal and river floods. The states coastla regions are regularly hit by cyclones and storm surges. The state¡¯s rivers frequently overflow after heavy monsoon rainfall either in the state itself or further upriver.

PRESS RELEASE

Addis Ababa, Ethiopia  The UN refugee agency and its partners have begun distributing urgently needed food to thousands of South Sudanese in flooded camps in western Ethiopia's Gambella region.

But humanitarian aid workers face major challenges providing assistance. The floods are also affecting the border crossings at Matar and Pagak and the Kule and Tierkidi camps, with many refugees making their way to drier ground.

In Leitchuor and Nip Nip, which together hold some 50,000 people, the continuing heavy rains have destroyed traditional shelters (tukuls) and temporary structures and forced refugees to move to higher ground, near the host community. UNHCR and the government have started to look at possible new sites where they can relocate the most vulnerable.

A rapid needs assessment, conducted last week by an inter-agency team, including UNHCR, found that both refugees and locals need food and water above all else. The situation is most serious at Nip Nip, because the floodwaters have made the road impassable and water tankers cannot reach the camp.

Based on the results of the needs assessment, the World Food Programme, with help from the government's refugee agency and UNHCR, has distributed general food rations, including sorghum, lentils and cooking oil. UNHCR is also distributing tents, plastic sheets, sleeping mats and hygiene and sanitation items in unflooded areas of Leitchuor and Nip Nip.




UNHCR and other humanitarian organizations working at the two camps are looking at the most effective ways to distribute more relief supplies, including water purification tablets, and how to help people access mobile health and nutrition clinics.

The refugee agency is also helping to step up mass information campaigns for the refugees, to give them daily updates on services available, the flood situation and advice on how to prevent outbreaks of disease.

The rains and floods pose serious public health threats because latrines and sanitation facilities have been destroyed. Malaria, Hepatitis E and cholera are the biggest threats.

Description of the Event
Torrential rain in Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, has caused flooding which has led to two deaths and an estimated 20,000 people evacuated.
Rio Grande do Sul is Brazil's most southern state, and borders Uruguay and Argentina. A state of emergency was declared in the state on 4 July 2014, following over a week of rain which began on 26 June. So far 115 towns and cities have been affected by the flooding across the state, which includes the state capital, Porto Allegre.
It is believed that the weather has been caused by the El Ni?o effect, which warms the Pacific Ocean and usually results in hot and wet summers for South America.
This latest flood follows on from another batch of torrential rain which affected southern Brazil, and particularly Rio Grande do Sul's nearby states of Santa Catarina and Paran¨¢, in early June. The prolonged rainfall is expected to harm the area's agricultural production, due to saturated ground conditions.

"16 Killed in Nepal Floods in 2 Weeks
Posted by Richard Davies on July 14, 2014
At least 9 people have been killed in floods and landslides in Sindhupalchok, Lalitpur and Chitwan districts of Nepal over the last 2 days. Heavy rain has fallen across the central Nepal region since 13 July 2014. The latest spate of disasters comes after 7 people died between 7 and 8 July 2014 after floods in Dang, Rautahat and Udaypur, as reported by The Himalayan Times.

Floods have struck in various parts of Sindhupalchok district over the last 2 days causing landslides and damage to houses. Six of the victims were caught in their homes as landslides or torrential rainfall caused the buildings to collapse.

Two other victims were working in a quarry in Lele, Lalitpur when they were caught in a landslide. One other victim, a woman, was swept 300 metres downstream by flood water in Chitwan, where around 650 homes are said to have been flooded."
"30 Villages Under Water in Bhola, Bangladesh
Posted by Richard Davies on July 14, 2014
As many as 30 villages in the Bhola District in the Division of Barisal, Bangladesh have been inundated after flood water from the overflowing Meghna River swept over broken dykes. The river levels had been swollen by recent rain fall, but also dramatically increased after a high tide on Sunday 13 July 2014.

According to local media reports, the floods have affected the upazilas (sub-districts) of Monpura and Charfashion. Houses, schools, mosques, farmland and fish enclosures have been flooded, with some areas are said to be under around 1 metre (over 3 feet of water). Transport has also been affected, particularly since many river ferry terminals and gangways are also under water.

Normally these areas are protected by a flood control dyke. The dyke in this area along the Meghna River is extremely be vulnerable to the river erosion. It is a constant battle for authorities such as the Water Development Board to repair and upgrade embankments. Large stretches of the Bhola District emabnkment collapsed last year and local residents are still awaiting its repair. Locals are blaming the current floods on the fact that no proper action has been taken to repair the dyke. It seems that poor planning meant that work to carry out repairs was only ordered as recently as last month ¨C way too late to complete any substantial work before the rainy season."

Update: 12:40 p.m.

The city and borough of Juneau has closed View Drive and all roads leading into Meander Way, from Rivercourt Drive to Killewich Avenue along Riverside Drive.

The city is asking that all non-essential persons stay out of the area, as roads may become impassible due to flooding from the Mendenhall Lake and River.

Power may be shut off to isolated areas affected by flood waters.

The city also has closed the Brotherhood Bridge Trail, including the pedestrian bridge.

Anywhere between 4 p.m. and 10 p.m. is our best guess for the peak, says National Weather Service Meterologist Bob Tschantz.

He says people should stay away from the saturated banks of the Mendenhall River.

They get under cut by the water that¡¯s running, and eventually the ground over the top just kind of sloughs off,¡± he says. ¡°River bank erosion is a very big concern and you don¡¯t want to be caught standing on the edge of the riverbank when it collapses into the river.¡±

Instead of football players, crossing the pitch is a small motorboat and passing through the goalmouth is the overflowing Rio Negro river.

The goalposts stand half submerged, now meaningless markers on an invisible field.

For more than a month, Careiro da Varzea in the Brazilian state of Amazonas has been under water in one of the worst floods on record.

It is one of almost 40 areas in Amazonas in an emergency situation or a state of calamity affecting more than 300,000 people.

Water pours through wooden bungalows in river communities, standing stagnant on the floors of their homes, bringing waterborne diseases and making access difficult without a boat.

Since the end of last year, heavy rains have pushed the Rio Negro, which flows into the Amazon, to emergency levels.

Map showing the Manaus region of Amazonas state in Brazil
Meanwhile, the biggest tributary of the Amazon, the Rio Madeira, reached record heights and caused the worst flooding for a century across more remote parts of north-west Brazil and northern Bolivia.

Experts say the water is expected to remain until the middle of July before eventually subsiding, leaving those who live on the river to rebuild their vulnerable homes.

""We consider a situation to be extreme when the river reaches the emergency level,"" explains Marco Antonio de Oliveira, who is the regional superintendent of the Brazilian Geological Service in Manaus, the capital of Amazonas.

""In this year's floods, the river reached emergency levels on 22 May. We have spent practically the whole of June above the emergency level.

""It's likely that this year, the time that the water has remained high and inside the homes of some of the poorest in Manaus will surpass 50 days.""

"Good response to farmers' call for help
Kevin Ikin, Rural Reporter - kevin.ikin@radionz.co.nz
Updated at 4:19 pm on 14 July 2014
Tweet on Twitter Share on Facebook
The Northland Rural Support trust has had an immediate response to its call for emergency feed and grazing to help flood-stricken farmers in the region.
The trust has been closely monitoring the impact of the past week's storm and prolonged rainfall, and put out the call for help on Sunday.
Co-ordinator Julie Jonker said little grazing had been offered but farmers from as far away as Manawatu had offered to send feed, which was in short supply in Northland following the drought.
""We've got a perfect storm in that we've had a drought. People often use some of their winter supplements to get them through the drought period and now, when we were hoping for a mild, not-too-wet winter, we ended up with a flood as bad as the 2007 one that we had,"" she said.
""We also had those strong winds, and there was a lot of damage to infrastructure such as cow shed roofs blowing off, calf and hay sheds damaged, so chances are some feed supplements may have been damaged as well.
""We are still trying to quantify exactly what the damage is, not only financially but to the farmers involved.""
Farmers in the flood-prone Hikurangi Swamp area, north of Whangarei, had been among the hardest hit, Ms Jonker said.
Up to 30 farms there were flooded, and at least nine more downstream at Tangiteroria.
Weeks to clear
One of the flooded Hikurangi Swamp farmers, Ben Smith, said up to 70 percent of his effective dairy farm was under water and it would take weeks for the water to clear.
""The worst of us will be three to four weeks, so we'll have dead pasture from then. Depending on how well spring treats us, we'll need eight weeks after that to get the first grazing off the pasture, so you're talking two or three months, basically,"" Mr Smith said.
Evan Sneath, a dairy farmer at Hukerenui at the top end of Hikurangi Swamp, said flood levels had dropped a little but he still had about 60ha of land under water, and he was waiting for local council approval to cut the flood banks to clear the water more quickly.
""What we're trying to do there is let the water off our land quicker so we can get back on and start getting stuff in - grass seed or whatever we're going put back into it, and also to try and keep water quality,"" Mr Sneath said.
""The longer the water sits on our farm, the water quality deteriorates rapidly and it gets to the point where, if it sits too long, there's no oxygen left in the water and, going back into the streams, it starts killing off fish life and everything.""
Mr Sneath said he would also have to replace dead pasture, and he was making arrangements to truck in supplies of hay, silage and other supplementary feed.
""I'm doing that off my own bat but I'm also going to get in touch with Rural Support to try and look for some grazing for my young stock.""
Farmers who can help with feed or grazing should contact the Northland Rural Support Trust on 0800-787-254.////Three rescued, one missing in floods

"Extent of farmland damage from floods trickles in

ST. LOUIS (AP) -- As the rain-swollen Mississippi River carried on its plodding retreat Friday, western Illinois farmer Joe Zumwalt wasn't complaining about the flooding that wound up swamping a hundred or two of his 3,500 river-bottom acres of corn and soybeans.

Zumwalt lost all of it just a few years ago in 2008, when two of the region's levees couldn't hold back the engorged river, ultimately submerging tens of thousands of acres of farmland.

""I think what's happened this year is proof that the levees work,"" said Zumwalt, 36. ""If you stand on the top of the levee and look at the amount of water being held back and the potential devastation that could have occurred, you have to feel pretty good.""

The economic toll of Midwest flooding - typical of this time of year - only now is trickling in.

While officials say it's too early to estimate the flood's financial cost, the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Farm Service Agency says at least 383,000 acres of crops have been destroyed and 2 million damaged in Iowa and Illinois alone due to excessive rain, flash flooding, and flooding on the Mississippi River and its tributaries.

Crop damage in Missouri has not yet been reported to the USDA, Farm Service Agency spokeswoman Isabel Benemelis said.

The Federal Emergency Management Agency still is getting preliminary damage assessments from pounding upper Midwest storms that led to the flood, and from the flooding itself, spokeswoman Amanda Bicknell said.

""This is really a moving target,"" she said.

Buyouts of flood-prone property since the benchmark flood of 1993 - and newer, bigger levees - have limited damage this time around, even though this flood ranked among the 10 highest ever in several locations. Still, the flood has damaged roads and infrastructure, along with scattered homes and businesses.

The flood came at a bad time for farmers, with corn having been flourishing in the nation's midsection and soybean plants still maturing.

Around his fields near Illinois' Warsaw, Zumwalt had cause for jubilance: Crops on just 100 to 200 acres got ruined in the past week or two by Mississippi River water that weaseled its way under the levees. But the levees held, said the Hancock County Farm Bureau's president, and that's all that mattered.

""We're not talking about huge amounts of crop loss,"" he said. ""By and large, the crops in our area look very good.""

While retreating Friday in most places, the Mississippi still was 8 feet above flood stage in Grafton, Illinois, a town without a levee about 40 miles north of St. Louis. The river level there was expected to start dropping. Despite its lack of protection, damage there was minimal.

Both bridges closed by the flood have reopened. Traffic resumed Thursday afternoon at the Quincy (Illinois) Memorial Bridge. The Champ Clark Bridge at Louisiana, Missouri, was also open, but with one lane only, said Paris Ervin, spokeswoman for the Illinois Department of Transportation.

Impact of the Quincy bridge closing was minor because the town has two bridges. When the Louisiana bridge closed on Sunday, drivers on U.S. 54 had to go 35 miles north to Hannibal, Missouri, to cross the river.////June 25, 2014: ""CHICAGO  Minnesota was besieged on Tuesday by some of its most widespread flooding in years. Water spilled onto streets in downtown St. Paul, crops of soybeans and corn were damaged and a state of emergency was declared in 35 counties.The flooding spanned vast regions of the state, from the Canadian border to Iowa. It was the result of an unusually heavy snowpack from winter, combined with torrential rain this spring and early summer that had filled lakes and wetlands. A major storm that brought close to six inches of rain last week in parts of the state pushed the already swollen Mississippi, Crow and St. Croix Rivers to their limits.This is severe flooding, and in many different locations in the state, which I havent seen before, Gov. Mark Dayton said in a telephone interview on Tuesday. Ive seen severe weather  tornadoes, flash floods and ice storms  but usually they impact one area of the state. This one is the whole state.In St. Paul, the capital, the Mississippi River rose to a nearly 20-foot crest, forcing the closing of some roads. In Stillwater, drivers were diverted from a bridge that links Minnesota and Wisconsin. And in Delano, west of the Twin Cities, businesses close to the Crow River were quickly evacuated. Residents of Waterville in southern Minnesota resorted to sandbags to fight off the Cannon River.Officials expected the Mississippi River to crest in St. Paul on Thursday at 20.5 feet, the sixth-highest on record.¡°It¡¯s been quite a historical flood for this area,¡± said Craig Schmidt, a service hydrologist for the National Weather Service. ¡°We¡¯ve got large, large areas of the state that are underwater. We¡¯ve had some of our gauges hit record highs.¡±Weather experts said the flooding arrived unusually late in the year, leaving officials scrambling to control the high water with sandbags, flood walls and makeshift barriers.Mr. Dayton called it ¡°a building emergency¡± and planned to continue traveling the state this week to visit communities and assess the damage. President Obama is expected to stop in Minnesota on Thursday for an unrelated event, and Mr. Dayton said that he intended to discuss the crisis with him.Elsewh"" Midwest, flooding affected homes and businesses in South Dakota, Missouri and northwest Iowa. Roughly 150 homes in Iowa suffered major flood damage, officials said. The federal Department of Transportation has pledged $750,000 for the repair of flood-damaged Iowa roads.The mayor of St. Paul, Chris Coleman, declared a state of emergency there. In Newport, Minn., a small city along the Mississippi, a sand station was set up so that residents could make sandbags for their homes.Some city officials worried that infrastructure meant to protect cities from storms was hopelessly outdated.Deb Hill, the city administrator in Newport, said that a levee built more than 50 years ago to protect the town was in ¡°terrible condition,¡± and only two feet from being breached.Even if it is not breached, if the water level in the river stays high, the levee could collapse from the continued pressure, she said.¡°Someday it will collapse,¡± she said. ¡°We¡¯re preparing for that. Will it go tomorrow or will it go 10 years from now? Everyone¡¯s aware that it will go. It¡¯s just all anxiety and anticipation.¡±
Vickie Mirenda, an owner of the Peppermint Twist Drive-In in Delano, Minn., said that her business was safely across the road from the Crow River, but that nearby businesses had shut dow""ily.Her restaurant was unusually busy on Tuesday, and customers could talk of nothing but the flooding, she said, and the storms that threatened the region.¡°Every time we see a black cloud, we get nervous,¡± Ms. Mirenda said. ¡°I don¡¯t know where else the water can go. We¡¯re praying to keep the rain away.¡± ""ota Floods Continue. Posted by Richard Davies on June 25, 2014. Levels of the Minnesota and Mississippi rivers are expected to crest in the Twin Cities area over the next 2 days. The flood threat remains, in particular after further heavy rain in the north of the state yesterday. Local media say there are currently 8 state roadways or river crossings closed due to flooding across Minnesota. Governor Dayton and Minnesotas Executive Council voted unanimously to extend the state of emergency in 35 counties of the state yesterday.
Rain in the North. Parts of northern Minnesota, including Marshall County, saw over 4 inches fall in 24 hours between 23 and 24 June 2014. The Middle River is reported to have burst its banks, affecting parts of the city of Middle River. Hastings. Meanwhile, south of the Twin Cities, the City of Hastings saw some flooding after the Mississippi broke its banks. Some roads are closed in the city, but as yet there are no reports of any damage to property.Yesterday river levels at Hastings stood at 17.85 feet, which is almost 3 feet above minor flood stage, and just under the major flood stage mark of 18 feet. However forecasters say the levels are still rising and the river is set to crest on Friday at around 19 feet.Costs. The city of St Paul claims it has spent $1.7 million on flood protection efforts since the floods first threatened around 10 days ago. In Delano, the authorities there say the flooding from the ""row River has caused around $250,000 damage already. Minnesota state has a new disaster fund of around $3 million and it is likely that federal help will be required.Iowa Floods Start to Recede. Elsewhere in the Midwest, the flood threat appears to be easing in Iowa. After something like three times the normal average rainfall last week (3.7 inches), flood water appears to be receding across much of Iowa. Although there are still many rivers with levels at flood stage, water levels are now dropping and most of the flooding is confined to roads, farmland and parks rather than homes or property.""

"Paraguay River Levels Fall but Thousands Still Displaced
Posted by Richard Davies on July 10, 2014
According to Julián Báez, director of Meteorología e Hidrología in Paraguay, the levels of the Paraguay River in Asuncion have now started to fall. They peaked on Tuesday 8 July 2014 at 7.35 metres, then fell by 1 cm the next day. The measurement may be small, but levels are at least falling. In the lower basin area river levels are not expected to peak for another 2 days. In Pilar, the level stands at 8.43 metres and is expected to rise further.

El Niño Could Bring Similar Floods by November

Snr. Báez also said that he expected river levels to continue declining until October or November, when the rainy season starts. Forecasters believe Paraguay will see heavy rainfall in the last 3 months of this year as a result of El Niño. In other words, we could be seeing a repeat of the mass evacuations across the country in less than 6 months.

250,000 Affected across 10 Departments

Despite falling river levels, Paraguays National Emergency Secretariat (La Secretaría de Emergencia Nacional  SEN) reported yesterday that the number of people affected by the flooding of the Paraguay and Parana rivers amounted to almost 250,000. Those aff""cted are in Asuncion, and the departments of Alto Paraguay, Concepci¨®n, Presidente Hayes, Boquer¨®n, San Pedro, Alto Paran¨¢, Central, ?eembuc¨² and Misiones.////Jul 3, 4:32 PM EDT

ASUNCION, Paraguay (AP) -- Paraguayan officials warned on Thursday of a possible environmental disaster because a flooding river is threatening a dump site for toxic residues.

State environmental chief Marina Cristina Morales said the Paraguay river already has flooded the Cateura dump in the capital city of Asuncion. The river has risen nearly 6.5 feet (2 meters) above normal, though it was still 9 feet (2.8 meters) below the level of a containment site for toxic waste.

""he river continues to rise we will likely be facing an environmental disaster,"" Morales said.

The lower house of Congress approved declaration of an environmental emergency alert on Thursday and the Senate was expected to also approve the use of more resources, including $1 million aimed at preventing the contamination.

The flooding, after days of torrential rains, already has forced the evacuation of about 300,000 people near the Paraguay and Parana rivers. Most of them were still evacuated Thursday, sheltered in camps of improvised tents.

Paraguay's weather service forecasts that the swollen rivers will begin to slowly recede back to their normal levels by August.////June 25, 2014: ""Officials in Paraguay say floods caused by heavy rains have forced some 200,000 people across the country to leave their homes.
The country¡¯s emergency service said Monday that an estimated 70,000 of the people who have escaped the rising waters are from the capital, Asuncion.Paraguay has seen heavy rainfall in recent weeks, which has caused the Paraguay and Parana rivers to overflow their banks.
The flooding has affected the departments of Neembucu, Alto Parana, Presidente Hayes and Alto P""aguay, as well as the municipalities of Ayolas and Asuncion. Rescue workers have set up some 60 government camps to shelter displaced families and have distributed clothes and foods among those affected by the floods.Meanwhile, the recent heavy rains have also affected Paraguay¡¯s neighboring countries Argentina and Brazil.In Argentina, some 5,000 people have been forced out of their homes due to the flooding in the city of Formosa located at the border to Paraguay.This is while authorities in Brazil¡¯s southern state of Santa Catarina said that the recent severe weather has caused an estimated 519 million reals (USD 233 million) in damage.In addition, the southern Brazilian state of Parana has been affected by torrential rains this month, which have caused the Iguazu River to break its banks. The flooding killed at least 13 people in the state and left thousands homeless.""une 13, 2014: ""FL-2014-000077-PRY ""..""Paraguay, Brazil, Argentina all Hit by FloodsPosted by Richard Davies on June 13, 2014
Heavy rainfall has now led to flooding in Paraguay, Brazil and parts of north east Argentina. River levels, especially those of the Paraguay and Paraná rivers are dangerously high. Some stretches of the Paraná and Paraguay rivers have already burst their banks.
Brazil
11 people have now died in the flooding in the state of Paraná, where a total of 560,000 are reported to have been affected by flooding over the last week. The state of Santa Catarina is also affected. Further heavy rainfall is expected over the next few days.
Paraguay
2 people have been reported as killed in the flooding. A boy aged 10 drowned in flood waters near the Paraná River in Misiones Department yesdterday Thursday 12 June 2014, according to local police. As many as 160,000 have been affected in the country, with many of them in the capital Asunción. Further rain is expected, along with some strong winds and cold temperatures.
Argentina
The north eastern area of Argentina that borders Paraguay and Brazil is also experiencing flooding. The province of Misiones is worst affected, in particular Montecarlo, Puerto Piraí and Caraguataí. Roads and bridges have been damaged and thousands are believed to have been cut off from the outside world as a result. Further heavy rainfall has been forecast for the next 24 hours.
Iguazu Falls
As happened during flooding around the same time last year, authorities have closed the famous Iguazu Falls to tourists while water levels are so high. The safety of walkways around the falls has been compromised and the situation is considered to be too dangerous to allow tourists to the site.
2 Months of FloodingFlooding is farily frequent in this region of South America where the 3 countries meet. In fact the situation is very similar to the 2013 flooding of the Paran¨¢ River that  affected Paraguay, Argentina and parts of Brazil. One feature of last year¡¯s floods to bear in mind was just how long they went on for. In 2013 the flooding lasted for almost 2 months, starting in early June and continuing through to the end of July.
1982 to 1983 Floods
One of the worst floods of the Paran¨¢ river was during 1982 to 1983. The flooding affected Paraguay, Brazil, Argentina and Bolivia. 600,000 people were displaced, and there were 170 casualties killed in the floods.
Chile
Although not directly related to the flooding of the Paraguay and Paran¨¢ rivers, Chile is also experiencing floods in central and southern regions. Around 1,600 people have been displaced"" roads have been damaged leaving some communities isolated.
Floods in the first few days of June this year left around 4,000 people stranded in central and southern Chile.The intense rains in Paraguay, which started in March 2014, have been unusually intense for the season, leading to severe floods in rural communities and urban areas. The effects have continued to be felt with the flooding from the rapidly rising Paran¨¢ river and Paraguay river. To date, 39,000 families (195,000 people) from five departments in the country have been affected by the flooding and require humanita""an support. The most recent rains registered in the upper basin of the Iguaz¨² river have led to the overflowing of this riverbed and the subsequent increase of water levels in the Paran¨¢ river. This has led to the increase in the amount of water in the reservoir of the Itaip¨² and Yacyreta dams, which has required both dams to increase their water flow which in some cases has reached between 22,000 m?/s and 43,000 m?/s. As a consequence, the impact has been extreme for the riverside populations located in Alto Paran¨¢, Misiones and ?eembuc¨².

"March 27, 2014: ""Windhoek ¡ª With ongoing widespread rains in the SADC region the level of the Zambezi river is heading for the 5.50m mark before the beginning of April, which would mean more conditions of flooding in Namibia. Between Monday and Tuesday, the river level stood around 5.05m and 5.1m compared to last year's 5.71m around the same time. According to the Namibia Hydrological Services (NHS) daily bulletin released on Monday, the perennial rivers continue to rise significantly countrywide.""he Zambezi river is maintaining its rapid rise and the river levels in Katima Mulilo have reached the critical range. The overflow in the Zambezi floodplains has started and easy access is inhibited. The Chobe river's spillage is pushing westwards into Liambezi lake,"" the NHS bulletin states.Taking into account the rapid rising water levels, Patrick Kompeli, the agricultural research technician in the Ministry of Agriculture, Water and Forestry yesterday said the Kalimbeza rice project is also poised for possible flooding within the next week or two, which would cause destruction to property and lead to a possible poor rice harvest.
""There is a possibility of the project being flooded if the river levels keep rising with the next two weeks. Fortunately, we already harvested the short rice varieties - Irga and Angola - last month. At the moment, there is only Supa in the field, which is the tall variety. Supa can normally survive the flood because of its tallness,"" he said. Supa is expected to be harvested around May.
Kompeli anticipated the project would harvest about 50 tonnes of the three rice varieties. ""When you mill, you only get 60 percent of what you have harvested and only that rice can be sold, the rest (40 percent) is broken rice,"" he noted. Milling is expected to start next week once the new milling machine is installed. Further, the NHS also reported very good rains in the Cuvelai delta, with Oshikango being heavily affected by rain. In addition, the Hoarusib, Ugab, Omatako and Cuito catchment areas also received good rains.The NHS cautioned that as a consequence of heavy rains the road between Omafo and Okalongo which is under construction is very bad for driving, the road being slippery and difficult to overtake on.""Flooding in the Cuvelai oshanas are mainly from a combination of localized rainfall, water coming from the head waters in Angola and soil saturation. The floodwaters have passed the northern border and contingency and preparedness plans need to be put into gear or action,"" warns the NHS.The NHS reported that the level of the Orange river on Namibia's southern border has also started to rise because of the flooding observed upstream one week ago, while at Brand Karos the level is rising rapidly.""With the local soils already waterlogged due to good rains over the past weeks, extra flows from upstream of catchments will worsen the flooding situation,"" the NHS cautioned.

March 3, 2014:  ""Changes to the Tokwe-Mukosi Dam's design made more than a decade ago could have contributed to the flaws that have caused the displacement thousands of families earlier this year, according to a recent report published by The Financial Gazette of Zimbabwe.

HydroWorld.com reported in February that more than 4,500 residents in areas downstream from Tokwe-Mukosi had been evacuated following heavy rains in Zimbabwe's Masvingo province after water began leaking through cracks in the dam's walls.
According to The Financial Gazette's report, French design firm Coyne et Bellier was first commissioned to provide a study for the dam and a hydropower plant in Fall 1967.
The idea was tabled during decades of political unrest before being resurrected in 1980, with Coyne et Bellier providing further studies in the mid-1980s. The group then proposed a concrete arch dam in 1992, though the design was changed after being deemed too expensive by the Zimbabwe government.
""[The design] was considered excessive and so the Designs Division of the Department of Water Development began a thorough investigation into the Coyne et Bellier design report and came up with a cheaper alternative in the form of a concrete-faced rock-filled dam,"" said a report released in 1998 -- the same year in which construction of Tokwe-Mukosi finally began.

"January 30, 2014: ""Jakarta, with a population of around 10 million, has suffered the brunt of annual flooding for the past several years, and the condition only tends to get worse with each passing year.In the current peak rainy season, which started in early January 2014, the floods in Jakarta have claimed 23 lives, displaced tens of thousands, and caused losses amounting to around one trillion rupiah.Taking stock of the current grim situation, officials, experts, and NGO activists have come out with various ideas on how to prevent floods in the future. The Jakarta administration and its neighboring districts announced various plans and projects, which are already operational or planned to be implemented, in order to deal with the inundation problem.Jakarta Governor Joko Widodo, also known as Jokowi, recently claimed that the capital city has built 1,900 absorption wells, while around two million wells are, in fact needed, to curb flooding.Out of 884 sewers and small rivers existing in the city, his administration has managed to clean up just 160 of them. Jokowi stated that he also plans to return the upstream area of the Ciliwung River in Puncak, Bogor, West Java, to its natural habitat as a water catchment area to prevent flooding in Jakarta, since the floodwaters mostly arise from the Bogor District.""The floodwaters have indeed come here (Jakarta) from the area above (the upstream area of Ciliwung river). That is what needs to be overcome. The root problem lies there,"" he recently noted.The governor further explained that the citys public works office will focus on constructing river dikes, since one of the main factors that triggered the floods so far, are the weak condition of the dykes. ""Therefore, this year, the public works office will focus on constructing dikes along the river banks,"" he emphasized, while inspecting a dike on the banks of the Ciliwung River.A new dike is being built on the western side of the Ciliwung River to curb floods and robs. On the occasion, Jokowi planted four trees along the Ciliwung River. There is also a plan to construct a channel to divert the waters of the Ciliwung River to the Cisadane River, but the Tangerang administration has raised an objection, as even now the Cisadane River often overflows and inundates the Tangerang city. 
Green and open spaces only account for five percent of Jakartas total area, while in line with the existing law, the city must allocate at least 30 percent. This is also one of the key contributing factors responsible for the annual flooding in Jakarta. angerang, Banten (ANTARA News) - Two inhabitants of Tangerang, Banten Province, died after being caught in flood waters that inundated the city in January.""During the flooding in January, two inhabitants were killed after being swept away by floodwaters,"" Iksan Bakti, the head of the youths emergency response team of Tangerang, said here on Saturday.The victims were Lukman, 22, and a 62-year-old man identified by the initials UW.UW was swept away by floodwaters on January 20 and his body was discovered three hours later. Lukman was caught in the flood on January 29. His body was recovered on January 31, 2014.Heavy rains earlier this week triggered floods that inundated four housing complexes in Tangerang.The floodwaters, reaching heights of 2.5 meters, swept through the housing complexes of Total Persada, Puri Cipondoh Asri, Home Affairs Ministrys DDN housing and Ciledug Indah, according to Iksan Bakti.A number of roads, including Ciledug and Parung Serab, have also been flooded.A total of 1,270 families have been affected by floods in the four housing complexes in Tangerang District.""About 1,270 families have been affected by the floods across four housing complexes,"" Iksan Bakti added.He pointed out that floods had affected Ciledug Indah 1 housing complex with 500 families, Home Affairs Ministrys DDN housing with 200 families, Puri Cipondoh Asri (70 families) and Total Persada (500 families).Meanwhile, the National Disaster Mitigation Agency (BNPB) reported that 137 people have died and 1.1 million been evacuated due to floods and landslides in Indonesia as of January 27.BNPB spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho stated in a recent press release that floods and landslides may continue to occur until March, due to normal rain patterns in the country, with its peak expected between January and March, except in Maluku and Halmahere, where peak rainfall is seen between June and July.

The improvement in the water position in the city had brought cheer to the residents and the farming community.The Bulawayo city council announced it has lifted water restrictions with immediate effect following significant inflows into the city's six supply dams.Saungweme said in some parts of the city there were traffic jams due to waterlogging as vehicles had to negotiate flooded streets after choked drains flooded the road network.Residents and pedestrians were seen wading through streets flooded by rain and overflowing drains.'Council had just repaired most of the roads and the flooding has damaged the same roads again,' Saungweme said.Elsewhere ten villagers in Gutu East district were airlifted by an Airforce of Zimbabwe helicopter after they spent over six hours marooned at a flooded Ruti Dam on Sunday. The villagers from Chitsa and Gudza communal lands spent over six hours on top of trees.Reports say they were picking up fish falling from the flooded dam wall, as heavy rains continue to pound Masvingo, one of the provinces experiencing long periods of extremely hot weather and dry conditions.On Saturday, a couple in Chiredzi spent the whole night on top of rocks after they were also marooned in Mungwezi River.

Thirty-two out of 77 provinces have experienced flooding since mid-September and 23 people have been killed, the Disaster Prevention and Mitigation Department said in a report, adding that 25 provinces still have flooding.
It said more than 2.8 million people were affected by the floodwaters and 15,254 had been evacuated from their homes.
Deputy Prime Minister Plodprasop Suraswadi said Thailand was not at risk from the remnants of Tropical Storm Wutip, which reached the northeast on Tuesday. However, he said the country should be ready for other storms.
In 2011, Thailand suffered its worst flooding in half a century. More than 800 people were killed and 6 million hectares (14.8 million acres) of agricultural, industrial and residential lands were devastated. Many of the country's industrial estates, which export electronic parts, auto parts and hard disk drives, were swamped, as were large parts of Bangkok.
Authorities have downplayed concerns of a repeat.
""Thanks to the dredging of the canals and the weather, at this point there is nothing to panic about,"" Bangkok Gov. Sukhumbhand Paribatra tweeted Monday night. ""Currently the water level in the Chao Phraya River is still low, so there's nothing to worry.""

But flood defences and evacuation warnings meant that only two people were killed in storm-related accidents.Accidents linked to the storm that roared across Europe have killed at least eight people, from Britain to Sweden, Denmark and Poland.Traffic ground to a halt on icy highways and train service was cancelled in large parts of Sweden. Tens of thousands of people lost electricity. Strong winds knocked down the city of Vaxjo's Christmas tree.Scores of flights were cancelled at airports in Sweden, Denmark, Norway, Germany and Poland. More than 1000 people spent the night at Copenhagen Airport where 200 flights were cancelled Thursday and about 70 on Friday.Strong winds threatened a collection of Viking ships recovered from the bottom of a Danish fjord in the 1960s and put on exhibition.Museum workers boarded up the expansive windows of the Viking Ship Museum in Roskilde, west of Copenhagen, amid fears water from the fjord would rise and shatter the glass.Police in Denmark ordered the evacuation of people in the towns of Frederikssund and Frederiksvaerk, northeast of Copenhagen, because of imminent flooding. The towns lie on the Roskilde fjord, which has seen water levels rise noticeably.Hamburg Airport, where almost all flights were cancelled on Friday, was open for business but cautioned that there would be cancellations because of wind and snow.Trains northward from Hamburg to Denmark and some other destinations were cancelled.Tidal floods that hit Hamburg in the early morning were akin to those that drenched the city in 1962, causing the worst flooding in living memory. But higher and better coastal defences along the North Sea these days have meant the impact of this week's storm on the city has been negligible, with no reports of major damage or loss of life.Meanwhile, wind farms in Germany reaped benefits from the storm. The country's vast network of on- and offshore wind turbines produced 25,205.8 MW of electricity, the equivalent of 25 nuclear plants and almost 35 per cent of the country's total energy output in one hour""  Some flooding in Rotterdam, Dordrecht as storm clean-up begins. December 6, 2013: ""A number of streets close to the river in Rotterdam and Dordrecht have been flooded following the combination of strong winds and high tides, according to media reports on Friday.The water is up to knee-high in parts of Rotterdam close to the rivers and areas of Dordrecht's historic centre are under water. There are also reports of localised flooding in nearby Maasluis.A temporary dyke on the Oude Maas river under the Botlekbrug broke through over a three-metre stretch on Friday morning, leading to traffic diversions. The dyke had been built because of roadworks on the bridge.In Zeeland, the water level along the main sea dykes reached 3.99 metres above normal, the highest recorded since the great storm of 1953 which killed nearly two thousand people.Weather forecasters say winds remain strong in coastal areas and there will localised snow and hail showers at times.The emergency services received 2,700 calls about damage during the height of the storm, as it moved over the Netherlands between 16.00 and 20.00 hours. In total, over 3,700 damage reports were made by 23.00 hours.

"November 18, 2013:Thousands of people in northeast Puntland, Somalia are coming to grips with the effects of the cyclone that hit the area between the 8-10 November.The storm has left several areas inaccessible and cut off from communication, making it difficult to determine the real scale of the damage. The most recent death toll stands at more than 100 and it is estimated that over 100,000 livestock have been lost, threatening the livelihoods of tens of thousands of people.The Somali Red Crescent Society mobilized its volunteers to evacuate people to safer ground and to provide first aid services. Volunteers are also collecting and burying dead livestock in an effort to stave off the breakout of disease.
As water levels began receding and roads became passable, the Somali Red Crescent Society dispatched two mobile health clinics and an additional vehicle to support rescue operations.

The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) is also stepping in to assist with emergency response efforts.

""IFRC has deployed a team to assist the Somali Red Crescent to carry out assessments and initial response in the northeast area of Puntland,"" said Kwame Darko, health delegate for IFRC's Somalia delegation.

""We also sent in non-food items such as kitchen sets, tarpaulins, blankets, sleeping mats, jerry cans and soap, initially for 100 families. We will increase this based on the assessment results.""

With fears of an outbreak of waterborne diseases, the IFRC will also deploy a water and sanitation specialist from the Regional Disaster Response Team (RDRT), as well as a health specialist from the Somali Red Crescent to take part in the assessment mission. The full RDRT remains on stand-by to be deployed to Puntland and Somaliland if needed.

This week's efforts will be concentrated in carrying out assessments in the eight most affected districts in the Nugal and Bari regions. Relief items will then be distributed based on the needs of affected families.

This cyclone is just one of the many silent disasters occurring around the world, most of which usually go unreported in international media and are often out of the public eye, failing to attract sufficient funding and resources to provide essential humanitarian aid. However, for those affected, the consequences are catastrophic with lives and livelihoods lost.

An average of 91 per cent of Red Cross and Red Crescent disaster responses involve small or medium-sized disasters or health emergencies throughout the world."

"November 19, 2013:""OLBIA (Italy) (AFP) - Italian emergency workers searched house by house on the island of Sardinia on Tuesday after a Mediterranean cyclone triggered flash floods, leaving 18 people dead and forcing thousands to seek emergency shelter.Rivers broke their banks at the height of the storm on Monday, sweeping away bridges, bringing down power lines and flooding hundreds of homes -- some of them in low-lying rural areas that have yet to be reached.""We are looking inside homes, inside basements, particularly in outlying areas,"" Gianfranco Galaffu, local director of the civil protection agency for the worst affected northern part of the island, told AFP.""There is a lot to do. The activity is frenetic. For now we are taking care of the most acute emergencies,"" he said, adding that personnel and equipment were being sent in from other parts of Sardinia and mainland Italy.Thousands were displaced by the flooding, said Environment Minister Andrea Orlando.""Around 2,700 people had to leave their homes and are staying in community shelters or with their families,"" said Orlando, speaking in front of Italy's parliament.The minister announced that an earlier death toll of 17 had risen to 18.A government meeting on Tuesday declared a state of emergency for the island and allocated 20 million euros ($27 million) for emergency assistance, while the regional government provided five million euros.A few people -- estimated at between two and four by different officials -- were still reported missing.Rescuers said that more victims could be found in flooded homes or cars and that around 20,000 people had been affected.Soldiers and navy personnel were deployed in the region, as local rescue services said their efforts were being hampered by the damage to roads. Rescue dogs were also being used, officials said.""We are focusing on essential operations: saving human lives, assisting displaced people and clearing road access,"" Prime Minister Enrico Letta told a press conference after an emergency cabinet meeting.'An absolutely extraordinary event'""This was an absolutely extraordinary event,"" Letta said, with one expert telling AFP that a storm of such intensity and with such high rainfall had not been seen on the picturesque holiday island ""for centuries"".The port city of Olbia, a popular destination in the summer months, was swept by floodwaters which receded on Tuesday, and hotels, sports halls and private homes were being used to shelter displaced people.Many local residents voiced anger saying they had not been warned sufficiently about the impending storm but the civil protection agency rejected the criticism, saying the area had been placed on red alert.The victims included four children and an entire Brazilian family of four living in a basementThree people from another family were also killed when a road bridge collapsed onto their van near Olbia, while a mother and daughter were found dead in a car that was swept away in the city by surging waters.A 64-year-old woman died in her flooded home in Uras in the southwestern part of the island, while her husband was hospitalised suffering from hypothermia.The heavy rain and high winds meanwhile shifted to the regions of Calabria and Campania in southern Italy and officials said they were monitoring the level of the River Tiber in Rome.
The holiday village of Sellia Marina in Calabria had to be evacuated, ferry services from Naples to the islands of Capri, Ischia and Procida were disrupted and St Mark's Square in Venice was under water.Silvio Saffioti, head of the fire brigade for Sardinia, said that ""many pump trucks"" to remove floodwaters were themselves stuck in flooded areas.Civil protection agency chief Franco Gabrielli said the island was ""unprepared"" for the flooding, caused by 440mm (17.3 inches) of rain in the past 24 hours alone -- almost half the amount that usually falls on average in Italy over an entire year.""I have found a lot of willingness, a bit less organisation,"" Gabrielli said after flying into Olbia, where he was overseeing rescue operations.Experts blamed unregulated construction and poor maintenance of waterways for the flooding and said the problem was all over Italy, not just Sardinia.""The area was not well managed,"" said Claudio Rafanelli, an expert on geological risks.""You cannot build in flood plains and you have to keep the rivers clear. We are really behind on this.""

At least four dead and 1,200 homes damaged in flood
AUSTIN ¨C It's a Halloween nightmare that won't go away.Tirso Perez awoke to find shin-high water streaming into his living room. Outside, walls of water washed over his street and rolled into his lawn.A week later, Perez's neighborhood and many others are still reeling from the flooding as residents and volunteers dig out from the mud-caked destruction.After propping up his two Chihuahuas ¨C Chico and Gizmo ¨C on a bed, Perez, 76, and his wife, Maria, 72, pushed their way to their front lawn and into waist-high water. It was the beginning of a harrowing three-hour ordeal that ended with rescue crews in a boat plucking the pair from a neighbor's roof.""e lived here 30-something years and never seen anything like that,"" said Perez, a retired state worker.This week, residents tried to locate tool sheds, cars and pets that floated miles away in the flood. Others pulled soggy sheetrock from homes.Austin Mayor Lee Leffingwell declared a local state of disaster Monday.The neighborhoods near Austin-Bergstrom International Airport were overwhelmed in the early morning hours of Oct. 31 when water from nearby Onion Creek surged past its banks and rolled into their streets, filling homes within minutes.They were caught in a historic flash flood with more force and volume of water than the city has ever seen. The flood killed at least four people ¨C including a woman and her 8-month-old son who were swept away in their car ¨C damaged more than 1,200 homes and sent hundreds of residents fleeing to higher ground.A torrential rainstorm that stalled over a limestone watershed prone to flash floods led"" the flooding, said Wendy Morgan, a city spokeswoman. Onion Creek rose 11 feet in 15 minutes and crested at a record 41 feet, sending walls of water into surrounding neighborhoods. The previous record for Onion Creek, set in 1869 and again in 1921, was 38 feet, Morgan said.The recent flood had a flow rate of 120,000 cubic feet per second ¨C nearly twice the force of Niagara Falls, she said.""t was flattening trees. It was moving boulders. It was pushing cars around like they were pieces of paper,"" Morgan said. ""It was a huge volume of water. There was no standing up to this flood.""""I'm still in shock,"" said Carmen Perez, Tirso Perez's daughter, who lost a home on the same street as her father. ""It all happened within 15 minutes. It was that fast.""Immediately after the flood, the American Red Cross of Central Texas opened two shelters that accepted 60 displaced residents, said Jose Dominguez, a spokesman with the group. That number has since dwindled to 45, he said. The Red Cross has not received any state or federal funding, he said.""The biggest need right now is permanent housing,"" Dominguez said. ""It happened in the middle of the night. People didn't expect to be woken up to such devastation.""The water started to flow into neighborhoods around 5 a.m. Oct. 31 and intensified until around 10 a.m., Morgan said. The water came on so hard and fast that it overwhelmed two river sensors in Onion Creek, she said. Emergency response teams were dispatched to manually measure the rising water.Earlier that morning, the National Weather Service had issued a flash flood emergency warning for the area ¡ª the first one Austin has ever received, she said.""e knew we had a record flood coming,"" Morgan said. ""What surprised us was the volume of water.""Emergency officials were thrown off because they had endured a drought for so long, said Toni Grasso, another Austin spokeswoman. ""It overwhelmed our resources,"" Grasso said of the flood. ""No one anticipated this.""Viola Brown was asleep the morning of the flood when a neighbor called to say water was rising against her front door. She should come to the neighbor's two-story home, the neighbor said.Brown, 70, packed her glasses, keys and a change of clothes into a plastic bag and headed to the neighbor's house. Halfway there, a surge of water knocked her down. She crawled to a stop sign, stood and held on for the next three hours, singing church hymns and praying as the water rose to her chest, she said.""I thought, 'This will pass soon,'"" Brown said. ""But it didn't.""Instead, the current strengthened, ferrying branches, uprooted trees and the tops of submerged cars past her, she said. Dogs and deer paddled frantically in the dark water around her.Finally, an Austin police helicopter spotted her and lowered a rescue worker on a cable to her. "

The central and southern parts of Hainan and Sansha city have already experienced torrential rain in the front of the typhoon.All fishing boats from the area are believed to have returned to port.The China National Marine Environmental Forecasting Center has raised to grade three warnings for very high seas and waves generated by typhoon Haiyan.China has a four-level typhoon emergency response system.Level one calls for a top emergency response, while level four represents the lowest.Meanwhile, in Vietnam, in the area that sits halfway between Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City, more than 200,000 people have been ushered into storm shelters to try to duck the worst effects of the approaching storm.
Mass evacuations have taken place in at least four central coastal provinces where storm shelters are now overloaded with people.170,000 soldiers have been put on standby to assist people who are affected after the typhoon hits.
Many schools have closed to allow families to find a shelter or higher ground.Typhoon Haiyan has been assessed by meteorologists as one of the most powerful typhoons ever to hit the area between the Philippines and Vietnam.
It has already caused massive destruction in the Philippines with around 10,000 people dead in just one area.
Officials have said they fear more people may have perished in the province of Leyte, where there are many small islands and outlying areas.Hundreds of thousands of people are reported displaced from their homes.
Tacloban on Leyte Island was badly hit with most houses totally destroyed.Many of them were flattened by the massive storm surge that accompanied Typhoon Haiyan. At times, waves were registered as high as 15 metres.There is no clean water, electricity or fresh food.Looting has been reported from some parts of Tacloban.Thousands of troops have been deployed to the area but are being hampered by damage to roads and power poles.The US announced on Saturday it would provided the Philippines with naval and aviation resources to help with relief efforts."

"October 15, 2013 ""PATNA: Seven people - three at Lalganj, two at Kaimur and one each in Madhepura and Khagaria - were killed when their houses collapsed due to impact of heavy rain and storm in the last two days. The moderate rain, which began on Sunday, picked up throughout the day lashing almost all districts in the state. The situation is likely to worsen as the weather office predicted a deluge in north and south Bihar districts in the next 24 hours. 

All major rivers, including Kosi and Gandak, are above the red marks. In Patna, heavy rains caused waterlogging in several colonies forcing people to remain indoors and postponing immersion of idols of Durga on Vijaya Dasjami day. Movement of railways between Muzaffarpur and Hajipur section remained suspended for more than six hours as trees feel down at several places between the two stations. 

Chief Minister Nitish Kumar called a meeting of senior officials and held a video conference with DMs and SPs. He reviewed relief and rescue measures in the low lying areas along the banks of Kosi and Gandak. The meeting, which was attended by water resources development minister Vijay Kumar Chaudhury, chief secretary Ashok Kumar Sinha, disaster management principal secretary Vyas, discussed measures following fresh alert by the Met office which forecast heavy rains in North and Central Bihar in the next 48 hours. 

Members of the NDRF were sent to Gaya and Ara from Patna. Four more teams have been rushed to North Bihar following threat to the embankments of rivers. 

Sources said Begusarai received maximum rain of 218 mm, followed by Purnia (106 mm), Katihar (103 mm), Muzaffarpur (93 mm), Vaishali (85 mm). Patna received 78 mm and other districts too witnessed rains in the excess of 70 mm.

Over 2.5 lakh people have been marooned in Balasore, which along with Mayurbhanj, are the worst-hit.
Here are the latest developments: 
The situation in Balasore ""is critical,"" according to PK Mohapatra, the state's Special Relief Commissioner, as flood waters from the Budhabalanga and Subarnarekha rivers inundated scores of villages.
Nearly half of Baripada town in the neighbouring Mayurbhanj district has also been submerged due to a worrying rise in water levels in the river.
Teams from the Army, Navy and Air Force, besides central disaster management agencies, have been deployed for rescue and relief operations in region. ""We are starting air-dropping of food packets in Balasore district immediately... The flood situation in the district is a cause of concern,"" state Revenue and Disaster Management Minister SN Patro said. (Read)

Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik, who visited relief camps in the cyclone-ravaged district today, was greeted by angry villagers who complained against lack of relief materials and demanded compensation. He has ordered payment of Rs. 500 each to those affected even as the administration will begin distribution of ration that will be supplied free of cost for the next two months. ""We will provide them money for rehabilitation and for crop damage... We are taking care of drinking water supply,"" he said.
Mr Patnaik also spoke to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh today and informed him about the post-cyclone situation and the state government's initiatives to bring back normalcy in the affected districts. He also requested the PM for technical support of Central power sector units for restoration of the power infrastructure in the state.
A part of National Highway 5, connecting Kolkata and Chennai, was blocked by several villagers today who were also agitating against the lack of relief material. Bhubaneswar: An unprecedented and timely evacuation drive, said to be the country's biggest ever, ensured minimum casualties as Cyclone Phailin slammed into coastal Odisha on Saturday evening. 23 people, including two in neighbouring Andhra Pradesh, have died in the aftermath of the ""very severe"" storm, which has since weakened.

""The first priority was to save precious human lives and to a great extent we have achieved that,"" Odisha Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik told NDTV. (Watch) But now, with Phailin moving further inland, there is flood threat in Mayurbhanj and Baripada districts of Odisha and neighbouring states of Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand and Bihar.

As Phailin passed through Odisha, nearly half of Baripada town was submerged due to a rise in water levels in the river, causing panic among the people. Several villages too were inundated as river Baitarani rose past the danger mark.

According to the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), the cyclone is now closer to Chhattisgarh-Odisha border and very heavy rains are expected over north Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Bihar, east Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal and Sikkim in the next 48 hours. (Read)

Heavy rains and surging seawater, accompanying Phailin, the strongest storm to hit the country in more than a decade, flattened tens of thousands of thatched homes, destroyed more than five lakh hectares of crops and knocked out power lines in Odisha.

The worst affected area, around the coastal town of Gopalpur where the eye of Phailin came ashore packing winds of 200 kilometres an hour, was still without power as emergency services rushed to help people living there. Hundreds of workers from the country's National Disaster Response Force fanned out across the region, clearing away fallen trees from roads, mangled power poles and other debris.

The Indian Meteorological Department or IMD, whose predictions for the cyclone were consistently below those from foreign meteorologists who foresaw higher wind speeds and greater damage, comparable to the 2005 Hurricane Katrina, stood vindicated. (Read)

"September 12, 2013  ""LYONS, Colo. (AP) -- Heavy rains and scarring from recent wildfires sent walls of water crashing down mountainsides early Thursday in Colorado, cutting off mountain towns, forcing the University of Colorado to cancel classes, and leaving at least three people dead.Boulder County was hit hardest, with up to 6 inches of rain falling over 12 hours. But flooding was reported all along the Front Range, from Colorado Springs to north of Fort Collins.
Capt. John Burt of the Colorado State Patrol said a storm cell moved over the mountains during the night, headed east over the Plains, then circled back around. The National Weather Service warned of an ""extremely dangerous and life-threatening situation"" throughout the region as the flooding forced people from their homes and caused mud and rockslides in some areas.""Move to higher ground now. Act quickly to protect your life,"" the Weather Service warned throughout the morning.Boulder Office of Emergency Management spokeswoman Gabrielle Boerkircher said many roads were blocked and volunteers were trying to help stranded people until emergency crews could arrive.
Boerkircher told The Associated Press one person was killed when a structure collapsed in the tiny town of Jamestown. Boulder County Sheriff Joe Pelle said another person was also found dead in northern Boulder.
""We're trying to get to Jamestown,"" Boerkircher said of a mountain community northwest of Boulder. ""A lot of towns need assistance, and we cannot get through.""Two other structures in the area were also damaged and may have collapsed.
To the south, Colorado Springs spokeswoman Kim Melchor said police conducting flood patrols found a body in Fountain Creek on the west side of the city early Thursday.
National Weather Service meteorologist Bob Kleyla said a 20-foot wall of water was reported in Left Hand Canyon north of Boulder, and a firefighter radioed he was trapped in a tree. He said rescuers were trying to get through, but were blocked by debris.
In Broomfield, U.S. Highway 287 collapsed when a culvert washed out, dumping three vehicles into the rushing water. Three people were rescued and had minor injuries.
Near Lyons, about 2 feet of water was standing on U.S. Highway 36 as a normally shallow creek known for trout fishing flooded its banks.
At least one earthen dam gave way southeast of Estes Park, the gateway to Rocky Mountain National Park, and water levels could rise downstream as authorities release more water to keep more dams from giving way.
A National Guard helicopter requested to help pull people from their homes hasn't been able to take off because of fog and low cloud cover throughout the area.
Flash flood warnings were issued for multiple counties in the region, including Jamestown and the Fourmile wildfire burn area.
Flash flood emergencies were also issued downstream from the Front Range mountain areas, including Fort Lupton, Dacono, Plateville and other farming areas as debris piled up near bridges.
An evacuation center for the mountain residents has been sent up in nearby Nederland, officials said.
Meanwhile, about 400 students in a dorm at the University of Colorado in Boulder were evacuated and classes were canceled Thursday and Friday because of the flooding.
Mudslides and rockslides were reported in several areas, with parts of U.S. 6, Boulder Canyon, Colorado 14 and U.S. 287 all reporting problems and temporary blockages during the evening Lefthand Canyon was reported blocked by one of the many slides.
Boulder police dispatchers were receiving calls of flooded homes and streets and submerged cars

Two younger sons and neighbors retrieved their bodies on Sunday afternoon.By 4 p.m. Monday, 85 people were confirmed dead and 105 were missing in the worst flood to hit northeast China in more than a decade.

Xinbin Manchu Autonomous County and Fushun County, also under the jurisdiction of Fushun City, were also seriously affected.Floodwater from the Hunhe river devastated many houses in Nankouqian.

The Amur and Zeya rivers, near the Chinese border, burst their banks near the town of Blagoveshchensk after torrential rain.

""Thirty years of dry weather made people forgetful, and they started building in places where there is a risk of flooding,"" says Pyotr Osipov, an ecologist for the environmental group WWF in the Amur region.

He remembers the record flooding of 1984, when the Zeya spilled across a wider area than today. But since then more villages and towns have grown up along the banks. Somehow people believed there would be no more floods.

""We had the river pouring deep into the floodplains, as far as 15km (nine miles). It is no surprise, as the river bed formed over thousands of years without human involvement,"" Mr Osipov says.

He argues that the authorities should have moved people from risky areas long ago. Now they will have to do it anyway - but also spend money on compensation.

Lawyer Boris Burdeyev looks at floods
Lawyer Boris Burdeyev says people were let down by complacent local officials
Boris Burdeyev, a 30-year-old lawyer, is outraged. ""Why did they give permission to build here?"" he asks.

His house, in the village of Vladimirovka near Blagoveshchensk, used to be a long way from the river, but is now submerged up to its windows.

""This isn't some kind of shanty town - all the houses were built legally, with official approval,"" he says. He built his home four years ago at a cost of about 3m roubles (?58,000; $91,000). He does not know if it will be habitable after the water subsides.

Local authorities are paying about $300 each to those forced to flee affected areas. There is a promise of more compensation to come from the central government. It all depends on the value of their lost property and possessions, and could stretch to tens of thousands of dollars per person.

Threat of looting
But Yelena, who works for a local nursery, cannot say how much she will get in compensation, if anything.

""You have to prove what property you had, you have to present papers, photos.""

Russia map
Although herself a flood victim, she helps other evacuees, who have been temporarily housed in a nursery school. Her own house, which she and her husband built in Vladimirovka, is now under water.

It was made of timber and was too close to the river, she says. A brick house would have survived, but theirs will be totally ruined.

There is more to worry about than the floodwaters. ""Looters are already working hard,"" says Yekaterina from the village of Grodekovo.

For the past 10 days she and her child have been staying at the nursery where Yelena works. Yekaterina's parents are still in the flooded village. ""They practically live up on the roof, surrounded by chickens, rabbits¡­ and looters,""she said.

But local residents say looting incidents have been rare. Grigory Nikishin, director of a holiday village in Belogorye, 20km upstream from Blagoveshchensk, said: ""We had a few attempts in the first days of flooding, but our security people and police chased them off.""

However, he decided to stay behind with several employees to keep watch over half-submerged buildings. ""All the ground-floor rooms are under water. The floors, tiling, linoleum is going to be ruined. All will have to be redone,"" he said.

Heavy rains lashing China's northeast and Russia's far east have not only unleashed massive floods but also looked to have stirred up bad blood, as the neighbours accuse each other of channelling unwanted water across the border.

The worst flooding seen in years has affected 3.7 million people and caused at least 72 deaths in China's northeast and prompted the evacuation of up to 100,000 in the Russian region.

Torrential rain in the past few weeks has burst the banks of the Amur River, which is called Heilongjiang in Chinese. The river runs through both countries and forms the border between the Chinese province of the same name and Russia's Amur, Khabarovsk and Jewish autonomous areas.

State broadcaster China Central TV (CCTV) said Russia's release of floodwater into the Amur has exacerbated the situation downstream in China. The water level of Heilongjiang near Jiayin county has risen by 30cm daily since August 7, CCTV reported last Saturday.

Some Chinese netizens have also hit out at Russia. ""Treating our Heilongjiang province as a reservoir for flood water. What a great ally!"" wrote a netizen nicknamed ""The Happy Life Of A Ghost"" on Sina microblog, referring to Russia.

Said Ma Airong, 50, a hostel owner from Heilongjiang's Mohe county bordering Russia: ""When they release water from their reservoir, we are affected.""

Four years ago, she told The Straits Times, she and other villagers were forced to flee to higher ground to escape the rising water.

Russian officials, in turn, have pointed the finger at China.

Vladimir Stepanov, head of Russia's National Crisis Management Centre, said in Moscow last week that most of the water causing the floods came from China, according to the Voice of Russia. If China keeps releasing water from its reservoirs into the Amur River, water levels could rise by 50 per cent, he added.

As of Sunday, 8pm Russian time, the Amur River near the city of Khabarovsk hit 6.49m, the highest since 1897. Radio Free Europe quoted Russia's chief health inspector Gennady Onishchenko, who warned on Sunday that flood waters from contaminated rivers in China are bringing harmful microbes and pollutants into the region.

However, Beijing played down talk of discord, with the Ministry of Water Resources saying on Sunday that both sides are working well together to fight the disaster. It noted that water inflow into Bureya Reservoir, in Russia's Far East, reached 5,050 cubic m per second last Friday, but Russia kept it at around 1,000 cubic m per second. 

""When flooding hit its Zeya and Bureya rivers, (Russia) made a strong effort to hold the flooding in its reservoirs, greatly reducing the flood pressure on the main stream of the Heilongjiang,"" it said in comments carried by China Daily.c"

Comments:  Heavy rains have resulted in a significant increase in the Parana river flow in Brazil, incr""sing pressure on the reservoir of the Itaipu dam, which releases water flow onto Paraguayan territory. This situation affects people located in the low areas of Paran? or close to the river beds in the Departments of Alto Paran?, Misiones, Itap?a and ?eembuc?. The situation is further aggravated due to the convergence of the Parana and Paraguay rivers which is flooding surrounding communities such as Paso de Patria, Mayor Martinez, Cerrito, Villalb?n and General D?az. Meteorological reports predict continued rains in the basin of the Igua?u and Parana rivers for the next few days, specifically in the departments of Canindey?, Alto Paran?, while Brazil's Parana state could receive more moderate rainfall.

Were starting to see the water tables start to drop, which stops the continued infiltration, where as soon as you pump something up it fills back up, said Bruce Burrell, Calgary Emergency Management Agency director.But Burrell warned that progress is likely to slow down. He compared progress to sponges, where work done up to now was like squeezing out a damp sponge and work being done now is like dealing with a sopping wet sponge.McLeod Trail, a major Calgary road leading into downtown, was reopened at 6:30 a.m. MT, but Memorial Drive and all bridges over Elbow River remain closed, said Burrell.Eighty per cent of roads have been reopened across the city, said Burrell on Wednesday morning.The Bow is still flowing at three times its normal rate, double the rate in 2005, said Nenshi.Towing in flood-affected areas
The city will start towing vehicles that are blocking access for flood-support equipment in affected areas.City officials are now asking people to go to nine Community Support Centres that have been set up, rather than tape paper requests to their homes. (Jeff McIntosh/Canadian Press)Previously, people had been told to put a sign in their window or make a 311 request if they needed to have power restored or water pumped out of their home.Now the city is asking people to stop putting signs in their windows, and instead to access one of nine Community Support Centres that were set up Wednesday morning. Requests through the 311 phone line or app will still be processed, but Burrell suggested that the centres would be more responsive because they are in the communities where requests originate.The centres will have representatives from Calgary police, fire, water resources, waste and recycling, development and building appr"
"June 17, 2013: Heavy monsoon rains since June 11 in Chhattisgarh's Bastar region have inundated dozens of villages and marooned about 8,000 people, mostly tribals, government officials said Saturday.All major rivers in the region, including Bastar's lifeline Indravati, have been flowing above the danger mark, which prompted authorities to rescue 300 families from catchment areas of the river. Two people were swept away by the swollen Indravati Saturday.
Reports from Bastar, Dantewada and Bijapur districts, confirm that at least 8,000 people have been marooned by the floods.
Bastar region, which is spread out in over 40,000 sq km areas, has been cut off from neighbouring Odisha by road due to incessant rain and overflowing roads.Meanwhile, the Chhattisgarh government has instructed authorities to launch rescue and relief operation in Bastar on a war footing.

"June 18, 2013: ""Flooding in North Otago's Waitaki Valley has been described as the worst seen in close to 40 years, and Waitaki District Mayor Alex Familton says the floodwaters have ""scoured"" rural roads.""The shoulders of roads are dangerous. There's rubble about and there is still in places water on the roads, so people will need to be very, very careful driving.""It would be ""costly"" to fix the damage, Mr Familton told Radio New Zealand.""I've seen some of the roads this morning and the water runoffs have caused a lot of damage - there's culverts that are blocked.""State Highways 82 and 83 were still closed, he said.Some rural residents were still cut off by flooded rivers.""That is not serious and water levels are receding very quickly - in fact it's quite a pleasant day forming here.
""I can see today as a day where we'll regain our shape somewhat, but we still have to be somewhat wary because there'll be a cold break coming through later on tomorrow, which won't help the situation at all,"" Mr Familton said.Yesterday, the State Hwy was closed from Otematata to Oamaru, with a lot of back roads closed due to major surface flooding and some were completely washed out and impassable.The Otiake River bridge was under water and the Otematata river was flowing above bridge level. Kurow police Constable Craig Bennett said, in that area, water levels were higher than road markers on the side of the road.Despite the closure of Grants Rd, one driver attempted to get through and found herself stuck in her vehicle.""The water is not only deep, it is cold,"" Mr Bennett, who helped pull her out, said.While some tourists were insisting on passing through, Mr Bennett said locals had been taking heed of Civil Defence media advice and acting responsibly.In areas around the Otematata river, water was coming up to the door handles of 4WD vehicles.""There's some pretty hard farmers that know that area well and are staying put,"" he said.The Kurow Racecourse is being dubbed by locals as Lake Kurow.""The amount of water that's flowing down is unbelievable,"" he said.The old Waitaki Bridges were holding up reasonably well, with the worst flows south of Kurow.""Meridian do a fantastic job of an even flow,"" he said.State Hwy 82 was also closed - ""jet boat only passable"" - and the Waihao Forks Bridge was also over flowing.Mr Bennett said he'd heard from a farmer in the area who hasn't seen flooding this bad for 35 to 40 years.He said it had been great to see the locals come together in a time of crisis, with flooding no barrier for Meals on Wheels - which were delivered by tractor yesterday.He urged people to follow Civil Defence advice and make sure they had enough provisions or contact emergency services.The Otago Regional Council said, in a statement, most North Otago rivers have peaked, but are expected to remain at high levels for at least 24 hours..""""Many Otago rivers are continuing to run at flood levels, causing widespread surface flooding.

The high-altitude road that is several kilometers long and considered the lifeline for reaching the border areas in this difficult terrain has been damaged at various points. At many places, it has just been washed away, at others, big boulders have broken down the road completely.The ghosts of 1962 war are still dancing in these parts of the border. The treacherous terrain, and the recent landslides, have yet again exposed the extreme folly of not developing the region because of a lopsided fear of Chinese military waves sweeping in through good roads. It was the defeat by the Chinese military that prompted the government not to develop road networks along the China border, but today that decision is haunting the lives of thousands and strategic military posts.
According to local sources, the only way to approach the border posts now is through helicopters, which is also not very easy considering that it is a difficult, high-terrain area. Alternate routes on the treacherous terrain is also very difficult, and not sufficient to carry a large number of Army men or supplies.
When asked for its comments, Army headquarters in New Delhi said the Dharali-Nelong stretch, north of Harsil, has witnessed landslides which are normal there. It said all the roads in the area have been washed away, but ""foot movement and connectivity are there"".Officers who were on their way to the post have been stranded and are currently helping in relief and rescue operations at Harsil, one of the last cantonment areas in the region. Sources said while adequate supplies and ration was there at the post, a delay in constructing the road could lead to constraints going forward.The bad weather in the area and the difficult terrain is expected to make this task difficult, and with the monsoon rains around, not much headway is expected here. With winter setting in thereafter, it gets more difficult as the whole area gets engulfed in heavy snow.Sources said a team specially brought in to construct bunkers in the border post had also been stranded. These have Army men from the Engineers Corps.The story of Nelong's single road and its destruction represents the strategic fallouts of deadly rains and landslides of last week. The single most important road on the Badrinath stretch, Rishikesh-Joshimath-Badrinath-Mana road is also broken at various locations. The story isn't very different in other stretches in Uttarakhand. And on the rest of the border with China, it would only take a heavy downpour to expose the poor Indian infrastructure, compared to the sleek connectivity up to the last post on the China side"". Thousands stranded in parts of northern India awaited rescuers on Wednesday as floods caused by heavier-than-usual monsoon rains killed at least 150 people in worst-hit Uttarakhand.Prime Minister Manmohan Singh announced a 10-billion-rupee aid package for the state after he and Congress president Sonia Gandhi did an aerial survey of the flood-hit region.¡°The government will not spare any effort in rescue and relief operations,¡± Singh said on his official Twitter account, adding the large-scale devastation they witnessed was ¡°most distressing¡±.¡°The priority for the authorities at the moment is to rescue the stranded and provide urgently needed succour to those most in need of it,¡± he said.This year, the rains are at least twice as heavy in northwest and central India as the annual monsoon rains covered the whole country faster than usual....

The good news is that the water level of Bhagirathi in Uttarkashi and Ganga in Rishikesh had begun to recede and rains may reduce in next three days. Meanwhile, the holy temple town of Kedarnath was the worst hit by floods and thousands of tourists were stranded in adverse weather conditions. Three ITBP personnel and two policemen were killed during a rescue operation in Kedarnath. Uttarkashi, which is transit point for pilgrimage to Kedarnath and Badrinath was also badly hit. The town witness another bridge over river Bhagirathi being washed away. Nearly 200 camps have been set up for those stranded. Rudraprayag was the worst-hit, where 20 people perished and 73 buildings, including 40 hotels along the banks of the Alaknanda, were swept away by the waters of the river. About 70,000 pilgrims, bound for Kedarnath, Badrinath, Gangotri and Yamunotri, are stranded in Rudraprayag, Chamoli and Uttarkashi districts with the famous char dham yatra still suspended due to massive damage to the road network. About 27,040 devotees are stranded in Chamoli, 25,000 in Rudraprayag and 9,850 in Uttarkashi, disaster management authorities said. Copters deployed More than a dozen helicopters have been deployed in Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh for relief and rescue operations in the monsoon-ravaged two hill states and all stranded people are expected to be evacuated soon, informed Union Home Secretary R K Singh, this evening. He said food, medicines and blankets were air-dropped in remote areas of Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh for the flood-affected people. ""We have provided seven helicopters to Uttarakhand. The state government has also hired four private helicopters. We are providing helicopters to Himachal Pradesh. Hopefully, all stranded people will be evacuated today,"" Singh said. Due to bad weather, the helicopters started operating only this morning. 50 pilgrims have been rescued from Kedarnath and brought to Gupt Kashi. Further sorties are in progress to evacuate the stranded. Highways linking Delhi and Haridwar, Rishikesh and Yamunotri and Gangotri and the Badrinath National Highway are blocked for now.

The monsoon generally hits north India by June end. But the movement of clouds was such that the entire country was covered with monsoon by June 16, a good month ahead of its schedule date for the first time since 1961. The rains caught everyone napping and brought about miseries to thousand of pilgrims, who would have normally finished their pilgrimage by month-end. Meanwhile, intensity of rains will come down in the next 3-4 days, and bring respite to the region."" ""At least 23 people have been killed in northern India after torrential rain and flooding led to homes plunging into the River Ganges and roads being washed away.More than a dozen people died in the Rudraprayag district of Uttarakhand state, while another 50 people were missing, said officials.A landslide triggered by the monsoon rains, which arrived weeks ahead of schedule, buried a bus, killing three in Almora district.Heavy rains eroded the soil along the swollen river, plunging several houses into the water.At least three people were washed away when a three-storey apartment building toppled into the water and was carried away by the swift-moving current, said government spokesman Amit Chandola.Many residents in the town of Yamunagar in northern Haryana state said they were trapped by the floods.The death toll from flooding and landslides triggered by heavy rain in northern India has risen to 70, media reports say.At least 45 people have died in Uttarakhand state, while flood-related deaths have also been reported in Himachal Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh.

"June 17, 2013: ""Three large barges were sunk over the weekend in a desperate effort to plug a massive breach in an Elbe River dike just east of Berlin. The operation became necessary due to continued flooding of several villages behind the break. It appears to have been successful.The fight against the record floods that have struck Germany over the last two weeks is largely over, with rivers having returned to their banks and clean-up well underway. But in one part of the eastern state of Saxony-Anhalt, the battle continued over the weekend -- and it was one in which authorities were forced to come up with an unorthodox method to plug a breach in an Elbe River dike just east of Berlin.On Saturday, two barges were sunk using explosives at a gap in a levee in an attempt to stop floodwaters from continuing to flow into the countryside. On Sunday, an additional barge was sunk at the site to block up the final 20 meters (66 feet) of the 90 meter breach. Helicopters carrying oversized sandbags and pieces of concrete then filled in around the sunken boats. Officials on Sunday evening said that the gap had been 80 percent sealed as a result of the operation.
The spectacular fix became necessary after the dike gave way last week, flooding several small towns behind the dike and resulting in thousands of people being evacuated. Now that the water has ceased flowing from the swollen Elbe through the gap in the levee, the flooded area behind it has begun to slowly shrink. Still, some 145 square kilometers of land (56 square miles) remain under water.
It was the first time ever in Germany that sunken ships were used to plug a hole in a dike. The barges were carefully maneuvered into place before explosives on board were detonated so as to ground the craft. Then, several helicopters began flying gigantic sacks of sand to the site to prevent the barges from drifting away.""It was an extremely difficult and risky operation,"" Saxony-Anhalt Governor Reiner Haselhoff told German news agency DPA. ""But we had to do something and to try everything in our power to stop the water.""
Captain Thomas Peter, who maneuvered the barges into position, said: ""We'd never done such a thing before. But we're not crazy. We were able to half-way assess the situation.""Elsewhere on the Elbe River on Monday, officials reported that water levels were well down from their peaks and were continuing to drop.""

PRAGUE, June 3 (Reuters) - Volunteers piled up sandbags to keep a swollen river from overwhelming the Czech capital's historic centre on Monday after floods across central Europe forced factories to closed, drove thousands from their homes and killed at least eight people.Six people died in the Czech Republic from the worst flooding in a decade and a state of emergency was declared, while in Austria two people died and another two were missing.The flooding, which also affected parts of Germany, Slovakia, Hungary and Poland, sent shares in reinsurers Munich Re and Hannover Re down by about 2.5 percent, with markets anticipating big claims from property owners once the waters recede.The flooding arose from several days of torrential rainfall. In some places two months worth of rain fell in just a few days.Carmaker Volkswagen temporarily shut its plant in Zwickau, in the eastern German state of Saxony, because the flooding stopped workers reaching the factory.In the centre of the west German town of Passau, people took off their shoes and rolled up their trousers to walk through the ankle-deep water.The last time central Europe saw similar floods was in 2002, when 17 people were killed in the Czech Republic, and damage estimated at 20 billion euros ($26 billion) was inflicted.Officials in Prague, the Czech capital listed by the U.N. cultural agency as a World Heritage Site, said they did not anticipate the waters of the Vltava river would reach 2002 levels.But they were taking no chances. They shut the metro system and, in streets near the river, soldiers put up metal fences - the sort of flood defences ordered after the disaster 11 years ago. Elsewhere, volunteers built walls of sandbags.Tigers at Prague zoo were tranquilised and moved out of an enclosure at risk from flooding.Czech officials said the flood defences in Prague should hold, but that the river level was likely to rise again on Tuesday morning. ""The story is not yet over here,"" said Czech Environment Minister Tomas Chalupa.CAFES SUBMERGED The Charles Bridge, a favourite spot for tourists that dates to the 14th century, was closed. Tree trunks floated by in the muddy brown water. A riverside path that is below street level, is usually populated with cyclists and people sitting at cafes, was under water on Monday.
""We left England yesterday and it was sunny and warm. We didn't expect this, we don't even have our raincoats,"" said British tourist Alison Tadman, who came to Prague with her husband, Adrian, to celebrate her 47th birthday.She and her husband were sheltering in a McDonald's restaurant. ""We're pretty disappointed,"" she said.

Some of the worst flooding was around the Danube river, which starts in Germany and winds its way through countries including Austria, Slovakia and Hungary on its way to the Black Sea. The river was swollen by heavy rain at the weekend.In Germany, the interior minister flew to flood-hit regions on Monday and Chancellor Angela Merkel was preparing to go on Tuesday, government spokesman Steffen Seibert said.How her government responds to the emergency could have some bearing on the outcome of a nationwide election in September.Shipping was stopped on parts of the Danube and Rhine rivers in Germany, and along the entire Austrian stretch of the Danube, because of the high waters. The rivers are important arteries for moving grains, coals and other commodities.

Thousands of people living in low-lying areas in Austria and the Czech Republic had to be evacuated from their homes. In the Austrian town of Schaerding, a duck swam across a road intersection, past the gates of a flooded cemetery.The flooding killed five people in the Czech Republic over the weekend and on Monday the death toll went up to six - a worker electrocuted while trying to switch off a flooded electricity transformer 50 km (30 miles) east of Prague, the Czech news agency CTK reported.In the Austrian city of Salzburg, 160 passengers were put up overnight in army barracks after the floods stranded their train. Austrian Foreign Minister Michael Spindelegger told reporters the situation in some areas was ""very fraught.""The risk on Monday was that the flood danger could follow the course of the Danube river downstream to other European countries along its route.Workers erected flood barriers along the banks of the Danube where it passes through the Slovak capital, Bratislava, and police shut several roads.""We are getting bad news from Germany and Austria. We have to do all we can to protect ... the capital,"" Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico said.In Hungary, whose capital Budapest also sits on the banks of the Danube, state media quoted Gyorgy Bakondi, head of the National Disaster Authority, as saying that 400 people were working on flood defences.He said water levels in the river could reach or even exceed the height seen in the record flooding in 2002.Some climate scientists cited a possible link between extreme weather such as flooding and climate change. The warmer the air, the more moisture it holds. A study last year by a United Nations panel of scientists said heavy rainfalls will become more common in this century. BERLIN ¡ª Raging waters from three rivers have flooded large parts of the southeast German city of Passau following days of heavy rainfall in central Europe.A spokesman for the city's crisis center said Monday that the situation was ""xtremely dramatic"" and waters are expected to rise further by midday to their level highest in 70 years.
Herbert Zillinger told The Associated Press that much of the city was inaccessible except by boat and electricity supplies have been shut off as a precaution.At least four people have reportedly died and nine are missing due to floods in Germany, Austria, Switzerland and the Czech Republic in recent days.."
"May 23, 2013: Description Nearly 300 homeowners were evacuated during the night, as were others farther south in Eidsvoll and in several other communities around southern Norway as rain and snowmelt turned rivers and creeks into uncontrollable torrents. In Eidsvoll, northeast of Oslo, around 40 homeowners were told to leave their homes because of fears a dam further upslope would burst. Others were evacuated in the counties of Hedmark, Oppland, Buskerud and Telemark as officials categorized this years spring flooding as the worst since 1995, so far.It may get even worse, with more rain predicted and more rapid melting of snow and ice at higher elevations. Instead of beginning to melt slowly at the end of winter, this years unusually cold spring kept the snow and ice frozen well into May. When temperatures suddenly soared last week, the annual run-off quickly turned into the gushing torrents now threatening so many areas that emergency crews were struggling to keep up with demand.

The pumping of flooded cellars quickly became a lower priority on Wednesday as crews worked to prevent more damage by trying to divert the deluge. Roads and major highways were blocked and closed all over southern Norway, with the heavily trafficked E6 highway through Gudbrandsdalen closed in several places. The list of closed roads was so long that radio announcers on Norwegian Broadcasting (NRK) referred listeners to the state highway departments website for the full list that was constantly being updated (external link, in Norwegian: ¡°Stengt¡± means closed).

State railway NSB and railroad Jernbaneverket were also facing enormous challenges, with tracks washed out in numerous places or covered by mud- and rockslides. Main train routes through Gudbrandsdalen and Osterdalen that connect Oslo and Trondheim had to be shut down and NSB couldn¡¯t provide alternative bus transport because adjacent roads were blocked as well. The Kongsvinger line to Oslo re-opened, however, providing some good news for commuters Thursday morning, but passengers were warned of delays throughout the day. Several long-distance truck drivers had to spend the night in or around Hamar because of highway closures that trapped them where they were, not least because their vehicles are too large to drive on the narrower secondary roads that were being used for detours. In addition to the evacuations in Eidsvoll and Kvam, around 20 homeowners were ordered ""eave their homes in Nesbyen and 43 in Nord-Aurdal.

There were reports they may never be allowed to return and will be forced to rebuild in other areas because of the increased incidence of flooding in recent years. Insurance companies were launching a debate over whether other policy holders should be expected to effectively pay for the losses suffered by those who insisted on rebuilding in areas hit by floods just two years ago. Politicians are expected to tackle the issue when the immediate crisis was over."" ""Flooding forces people from homes in Norway

"May 16, 2013: ""A tropical storm has lashed coastal areas of Bangladesh, killing 12 people, destroying thousands of huts and forcing up to a million people to flee.Officials had prepared for a cyclone, but the storm, called Mahasen, weakened considerably before making landfall.The storm hit Patuakhali district on Thursday with heavy rain and wind of up to 100km/h (60mph).Early reports suggest Muslim Rohingya living in camps on both sides of the Burma border were spared the worst.The United Nations had warned that 8.2 million people were at risk from Mahasen in Bangladesh, Burma and north-east India.Several Indian states issued storm alerts and warned people to take precautions against severe weather conditions.The storm weakened over the Bay of Bengal, however, and forecasters say it is likely to dissipate within 24 hours.Loudspeakers on trucks have been issuing warnings in Cox's BazarThe Bangladeshi government said it had evacuated 956,672 people from coastal areas to more than 3,200 cyclone shelters.Officials broadcast warning messages before Mahasen hit.Airports in Chittagong and the resort town of Cox's Bazar were closed, and Chittagong's port also remains closed, says the BBC's Sanjoy Majumder in Chittagong.The Bangladeshi authorities earlier raised the danger level to seven out of 10 for low-lying areas around Chittagong and Cox's Bazar.The cyclone covered more than 175km in nine hours before hitting the coast, Bangladesh's Meteorological Department said.A storm surge destroyed thousands of huts and caused flooding in coastal areas.All schools, colleges and some hotels have been declared cyclone shelters, and most were packed overnight.'Race against time'
In Burma, there were fears for tens of thousands of Rohingya Muslims living in camps in low-lying areas of Rakhine state.They were displaced by ethnic violence last year and many were reluctant to move from the camps.One refugee, Hla Maung, said he had lost his mother and two young daughters during the clashes between Muslims and Buddhists last year, and would not move from the camp.""I lost everything. I don't want to go anywhere. I'll stay here. If I die, I want to die here,"" he said.Burmese Planning Minister Tin Naing Thein said that in all, more than 166,000 people had been relocated.In the event, the storm changed course and appears to have caused only minor damage in Burma.Cyclone Mahasen earlier hit Sri Lanka, causing floods and mudslides that killed at least seven people, according to the country's Disaster Management Centre.At least 50 Rohingya Muslims drowned on Tuesday when boats evacuating them from the path of the cyclone capsized off western Burma. A 1991 cyclone that slammed into Bangladesh from the Bay of Bengal killed an estimated 139,000 people and left millions homeless. In 2008, Myanmar¡¯s southern delta was devastated by Cyclone Nargis, which swept away entire farming villages and killed more than 130,000 people. Both those cyclones were much more powerful than Mahasen, which hit land with maximum wind speeds of about 100 kph (62 mph) and quickly weakened, said Alam, the meteorological official.By the time it hit Chittagong and Cox¡¯s Bazar, wind speeds had plunged to 25 kph (16 mph), Alam said.

These floods have led to loss of property, damage to infrastructure and displacement of people,"" Russo said.Russo also said the flooding has been exacerbated by the locals who cut into river embankments to irrigate their land.She said humanitarian partners are supporting flood-affected communities with several activities, including pumping water from flooded areas, provision of non food items, water purification and rebuilding river banks to allow people to go back to their homes.""The good news is that we managed to intervene in most of the areas which have been affected by the flooding.

Floods have crippled public life and destroyed crops, huts and small buildings, while contagious disease, malnutrition and poverty have afflicted villagers.Governor of Lower Shabelle Abdiqadir Mohamed Nur said rain and floods have inundated several homes in Janaale and Wanlaweyn, damaging property and prompting owners to evacuate. Residents have turned to the municipalities and relief agencies for help and healthcare, as sewage mixed with flood water has caused a public health crisis, he said.The Shabelle River flooding has immobilised the town of Beledweyne and inundated dozens of villages, banana plantations and cornfields. Four children have perished in the town, he said.""We have registered traffic accidents and the collapse of fragile buildings as floods terrorise residents who have repeatedly asked for suitable accommodations before this season's tragedy because they knew the dilapidated buildings would not endure,"" Nur told Sabahi.Deqa Nurani Said, a 32-year-old mother of eight in Wanlaweyn, said she took refuge in a public primary school, but hundreds of other residents were sleeping in the open, near the main roads. No organisations have offered relief and rescue services or medical assistance, or attempted to help move affected families, she said.""We run the risk of famine and disease and temperatures are very low,"" she told Sabahi. ""Rains have continued to fall heavily over the past couple of weeks. Hundreds of residents have been forced to evacuate their homes, as floods have inundated all of the homes and warehouses in the town, which does not have any highlands to save them from the flowing flood water. We have also not seen any water-disposal operations or re-construction of riverbanks.""Middle Shabelle Governor Abdi Jinow Alasow said floods have forced residents in Jowhar to flee at night after water flooded their huts. Floods also cut off roads, telephone lines and electricity, isolating residential neighbourhoods.Alasow said he saw hundreds of families living in the streets. Life in Jowhar has come to a standstill at many main intersections, he said, and sewage has overflowed because there are no sewers.""The town of Jowhar, which is famous for cultivating rice and vegetables, has gone through some truly harrowing nights due to heavy rains, which have flooded the river,"" he told Sabahi. ""The city has never seen such a large amount of rainfall. Eight hours of rainfall were enough to submerge all the streets of the old town, some of which have turned into swamps.""

"April 11, 2013: ""OBOT, Albania (AP) -- Villagers in northwestern Albania are running out of patience after their homes have been surrounded by floodwaters for a month.They blame their ills on the operators of major hydropower dams that discharged vast quantities of water to keep levels manageable, and said Thursday the government has done little to ease their plight.""They get millions of euros selling the electricity produced by this water you see in my yard,"" farmer Hil Gjocaj said in Obot village, 120 kilometers (75 miles) northwest of the capital, Tirana. ""But not a cent of that money has come here to protect me and my business from the water.""The 51-year-old pointed in disgust to a water-covered greenhouse. Inside, his pepper plants - in which he has invested about 1,000 euros ($1,300) - lay under waters as placid as a lake's.Submerged orange and lemon groves stand around, while dry pockets that rise above the water here and there are covered in parked cars.A month after heavy rains started, more than 700 houses in the Shkoder district remain surrounded by three feet (about a meter) of floodwater, although their residents stayed on as most buildings are dry inside. About 15,000 acres (6,000 hectares) of land are waterlogged, and rafts or small boats are the only mode of transportation.Obot lies five kilometers (3 miles) from the national road. To cover that distance now takes half an hour by small boat. Most of the houses are two-story constructions, many built in the past two decades by returning immigrants - more than 1 million of whom left the impoverished Balkan country after the fall of Communism in 1990, to seek a better future in the west or neighboring Greece.Their choice of a site may not have been the best. The area has experienced severe floods three times in the past four years, and serves as a basin for surrounding regions.
Pellumb Dani, an official at the Shkoder prefecture, said Thursday that the area is prone to flooding whenever there is heavy rain, particularly as the country's three main hydropower stations that cover 95 percent of domestic electricity needs are built on the nearby Drini River.When it rains a lot, operators are forced to discharge water to lessen the load on dams that could otherwise crack. That goes downstream and floods the surrounding countryside. Dani said the volume of water entering the area in recent days was at times nearly twice as much as can be naturally absorbed or carried away by rivers.But farmers in Obot alleged that power authorities tried to stock up a lot of water in the dams during the summer, and the sheer volume of winter rain took them by surprise, quickly bringing reservoir water to near-dangerous levels.""There has never been flooding in spring,"" 83-year old Pjeter Gjocaj said from a verandah on his water-surrounded house. ""Me and the women have been imprisoned here for a month.""Power company officials weren't immediately available for comment.Authorities have been sending food and drinking water to flood victims, but farmers say their main concern is food for their livestock.""Flooding came at a time when we were to cut the grass (for fodder). Many cows or sheep are on the brink of death,"" said Denard Franja, a farmer who has started a side business as a boatman. ""Authorities have compensated us only for the first floods in 2010.

"February 21, 2013: :Floodwaters up to two metres deep have forced around 600 villagers of the Air Baluy hamlet in Sangadesa district, Musi Banyuasin regency, South Sumatra, to flee from their homes as rivers overflowed in the last two weeks.The floods have also reportedly affected five other regencies - Banyuasin, Muara Enim, Musi Rawas, Ogan Ilir, and Ogan Komering Ulu Timur - and inundated a total of 20,973 houses in the six regencies. The villagers have temporarily taken up shelter in houses and school buildings in nearby villages that escaped the flooding. Musi Banyuasin is the worst hit area. We have declared an emergency flooding situation in the area, said South Sumatra Social Agency head Apriyadi in Palembang on Wednesday. 

Apriyadi said that the administration had yet to calculate the total financial loss caused by the disaster. 

The social agency, he continued, had distributed 55 tons of rice, 800 boxes of instant noodles, canned fish and clothes. 

We have also established a number of posts at the border of Musi Banyuasin and Musi Rawas, Apriyadi added. 

Apriyadi said that this flooding was the worst since the 2007 disaster. The flooding, he said, was caused by non-stop heavy rains and widespread deforestation in the area. 

As of Wednesday, road access to Musi Rawas was still cut off by flooding, said South Sumatra Disaster Mitigation Agency (BPBD) Yulizar Dinoto. 

Despite the magnitude of flooding, no casualties were reported according to South Sumatra Health Agency head Mat Dani. He said that he had also sent medical teams to take care of flood victims. 

In Legok subdistrict, Telenaipura district, Jambi, the 240 families affected by a flash flood in December requested additional shelter as the four tents that had been provided were simply insufficient. 

Jambi Legislative Council speaker Effendi Hatta, who visited the flood victims on Tuesday, said that he would ask the administration to provide more tents. 

Meanwhile, the remains of two residents of Gitgit village in Balis Buleleng regency were found under the debris of a landslide that closed the main road connecting Singaraja and Denpasar on Tuesday night.

Members of the search and rescue team discovered the bodies of Gede Mertada, 35, and Gede Mulyawan Atmaja, 27, underneath mud and other materials on Wednesday morning.

It was reported that the two men, together with other residents of the village, had been working to clear the road of debris from an earlier landslide when another landslide occurred.

I Putu Dana, the head of the Buleleng BPBD, said that the landslides affected a 5-metre stretch of road and had carried heaps of mud, rocks, fallen trees and trash into almost all parts of Gitgit village, which is located on the main Singaraja-Denpasar road.

Gitgit and the neighboring villages near Bedugul resort, an area bordering Tabanan and Buleleng regencies, are very vulnerable to natural disasters because of their geographical and geological positioning. 

The villages are in the hilly areas of Mount Batukaru, surrounded by three major lakes - Beratan, Tamblingan and Buyan - as well as a vast forested area.

"February 1, 2013:""As floodwaters rose near Rockhampton and warnings of flash flooding were issued in New South Wales, Queensland was yesterday counting the soaring cost of this week's disaster.

Vast areas of the state were inundated, forcing thousands of evacuations, destroying homes, isolating communities and devastating farms still struggling to recover from the 2011 floods.

Agricultural organisations warned many farms might not survive.

Six people died in the floods, and search and rescue teams were yesterday still checking for more possible victims in hard-hit areas of North Bundaberg, 400km north of Brisbane.

The floods also ripped away many of the repairs and rebuilding of roads, bridges and other infrastructure carried out since 2011 as well as causing new damage that already appears to be overtaking the cost of the earlier disaster.

State Premier Campbell Newman said the bill had already topped A$2.4 billion ($3 billion) and was still climbing, exceeding the A$2.38 billion impact of 2011.


Insurers estimate the cost of the almost 26,000 claims received so far at A$290 million.

Newman said a permanent fix was needed to protect communities from regular floods and other disasters.

""We can't accept that our communities can be flooded every couple of years,"" he said. ""We can't accept that's how life has to be lived.""

Newman warned the cost would be huge, requiring a wide range of measures including the rethinking of developments, relocating parts of some towns, new levees and more flood mitigation dams.

The full scale of the week's inundation is only now emerging as waters recede and roads reopen, allowing access to areas isolated by floodwaters.

Some areas remain at risk. At Rockhampton, 600km north of Brisbane, the Fitzroy River was expected to peak at 8.5m late last night, below the 2011 peak but likely to affect more than 1000 properties.

Water was rising in some suburbs late yesterday, but authorities were hopeful most homes would escape.

The Condamine River was also still rising, cutting off the Western Downs town of Condamine. The small communities of Toobeah and Bungunya, near Goondawindi on the NSW border, were also isolated.

In Bundaberg, the worst-hit area where about 2000 homes were flooded, some residents were yesterday allowed back to devastated areas of the city's north as waters receded.

Access remained difficult and limited, with roads severely damaged. On one road floodwaters had gouged a 100m-long trench, 2m deep.

Power, water and sewerage had been cut, with no indication of when they would be repaired.

A packed town meeting yesterday was told that 10 properties in the area had been destroyed and about 30 severely damaged.

Bundaberg Council chief executive Peter Byrne said damage was severe, with one home washed onto the road and another missing.

""What I'm saying to you the gravity of the situation is dire,"" he said.

Journalists from Brisbane's Courier Mail, allowed into the stricken suburbs under police escort, described scenes of devastation: homes wrecked, some ripped from their foundations, and cars and trucks trapped in a quagmire of mud.

One weatherboard house had been driven 400m down the street and wrapped around a power pole. All that remained of others were brick remnants. A church had also been destroyed.

Southwest of Bundaberg, the town of Gayndah remained without power.

At Gympie, 160km north of Brisbane, residents and business owners returned yesterday to survey damage after about 150 properties were flooded when the Mary River broke its banks.

The Queensland Farmers' Federation estimated the losses at A$100 million across crops, sugar, cotton, orchards and dairy and pig farms.

Chief executive Dan Galligan warned disaster aid was inadequate and many farmers could not recover, causing severe and prolonged economic impact on communities already battered by natural disasters"
"February 11, 2013: ""Thirty people have died in recent days due to floods in northern Mozambique, local authorities said on Monday.
Amancio Nhantumbo of the Mozambique National Disaster Management Institute (INGC) said the flood-related deaths occurred in the province of Nampula and were caused mainly by drowning, acute diarrhoea and lightning.Nearly 2 000 homes have been destroyed in the area, INGC said, with thousands of displaced families living in resettlement camps.Nampula authorities were carrying out compulsory evacuations of residents living in low-lying areas at risk of further flooding.In southern Mozambique, floods have killed 105 people and displaced 150 000 since the beginning of the rainy season in October.Meanwhile, Cahora Bassa hydroelectric CEO Antonio Muxanga told reporters that transmission lines carrying electricity to South Africa were under threat and could collapse at any time.The United Nations emergency humanitarian fund today announced it will distribute more than $5 million to provide life-saving assistance to hundreds of thousands of people who have been affected by the recent floods in Mozambique.Heavy rains last month led to massive flooding in the southern part of the country, killing 105 people and displacing some 150,000. Hundreds of houses were destroyed and crops and infrastructure severely damaged.In a news release, the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said the Government and its partners have already allocated $10 million to cope with the emergency. However, given the scale of the disaster, more resources are required for those who lost everything in the floods.The funds, $5.13 million in total, will be distributed from the UN Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF"", which is managed by OCHA, to various UN agencies to provide basic needs and services such as shelter, food, medical aid, water, sanitation and hygiene, and logistical protection to those in need.¡°While much has been done, much more is needed. These CERF funds will go a long way in ensuring that assistance is provided to those who need it most,¡± said the UN Resident Coordinator in Mozambique, Jennifer Topping.
The World Food Programme (WFP) will receive $2.3 million, and more than $1 million will be allocated to the UN Children¡¯s Fund (UNICEF) and the International Organization for Migration (IOM), respectively. A further $820,000 will be given to a joint UNICEF/UN Population Fund (UNFPA)/World Health Organization (WHO) project""nuary 31, 2013: Maputo, Mozambique - The United Nations says the death toll from the flooding in Mozambique has risen by seven to at least 55 people.The U.N. said Thursday that heavy rains in northern and central Mozambique have displaced 19 000 more people, raising the total number of displaced by floods the past two weeks to nearly 170 000.
The Mozambican government said there is a shortage of food for flood victims in southern Mozambique. Luis Nhala, a health official, said that residents are eating food that has mixed with contaminated flood water, which is resulting in cases of diarrhoea and vomiting.""January 15, 2013:""MAPUTO, Jan 22  Mozambique authorities on Tuesday considered the evacuation of 50,000 people after heavy rainfall in the flood-struck south, where hundreds died in a major deluge over a decade ago, an UN aid agency said.
The waters have killed 35 people since the start of the rainy season last October  13 in January alone  and eight major rivers are above alert levels.

The alert level is five metres (16 feet). Yesterday it reached six (metres). If it will go one more metre then it will create a big problem, said Hanoch Barlevi, local emergency specialist at the United Nations Childrens Fund (UNICEF).
If this scenario happens, the community that is going to be affected is around 50,000 people, he told AFP.
The southern Africa nation is experiencing the heaviest rainfall since devastating floods in 2000 killed around 800 people and affected millions.
According to Barlevi, authorities have since developed sophisticated disaster management systems, so a repeat of the tragedy is unlikely.
From Sunday to Monday almost 185 millimetres (over seven inches) of rain poured over the Limpopo river basin in southern province Gaza, where the most vulnerable communities live.
Rains in neighbouring countries also swelled rivers, and authorities opened the sluices from two dams in the south to lower dangerous levels.
Coastal Mozambique is home to nine international river basins, making it especially vulnerable to flooding. Although the rainfall has stopped in most areas, the risk of flooding remains high as waters arrive from further inland.
¡°Unfortunately there are always consequences from the entire region and not only in Mozambique. The rain stops but the effects come a few days later,¡± Barlevi explained.
Mozambique¡¯s disaster management teams are set to meet later Tuesday to decide on evacuations.   Beitbridge Bureau ¡ª ZIMBABWE and South African border authorities were yesterday forced to stop both vehicular and human traffic after the bridge at the Beitbridge Border Post was flooded on Sunday night.

The border was only open to travellers after 3am when the waters subsided.

The torrential rains also claimed the lives of three children aged between four and nine years when the houses they were sleeping in collapsed.

Authorities at the border post were forced to stop traffic after the floo""impopo River left the New Limpopo Bridge inaccessible.

The bridge links Zimbabwe and South Africa.

The bridge was temporarily closed for three hours at midnight on Sunday.

It was only reopened at around 3am when the water had subsided.

Border authorities from both countries had to harmonise traffic control systems to ensure the safety of motorists.

They also temporarily suspended movement of heavy vehicles over the bridge.

The Old Limpopo Bridge was safe for pedestrians though the situation was under close monitoring by the authorities.

The children's deaths bring to five the number of people who have died in Beitbridge District due to torrential rains that started last week.

Two people drowned, one along Bubi River and another one in a pond in the town.

Forty-two more people were stranded at Chituripasi Village 10, under Chief Elsh Matibe's area.

Their huts were destroyed by heavy rains that hit the area on Saturday and Sunday.

Authorities had also dispatched an Air Force of Zimbabwe helicopter to assist stranded villagers yesterday afternoon.

Beitbridge Civil Protection Unit chairman Mr Simon Muleya said the situation was terrible. Three children were killed in separate incidents when their homes collapsed during heavy rains in Limpopo over the weekend, authorities said.


Vhembe district municipality spokesperson Matodzi Mulaudzi said on Sunday the municipality's disaster management team received the reports about the deaths of two boys and a girl on Sunday morning.

Floods in the past two weeks following a long drought have left more than 20 people dead, houses destroyed and large stretches of agricultural land devastated due to flooding and resulting landslides. (The parched land cannot absorb the sudden water.) 

Hundreds of families have been displaced in the floods, which have occurred during post-New Year festival time. The capital of Nairobi, as well as the Nyanza and North Rift regions, have all been affected.

In the Rift Valley region of Marakwet, where CWS is responding, at least 10 people, including three children, have perished in the landslides.

""Red Cross and Government personnel with assistance from villagers made frantic efforts to look for survivors, some of who were rushed to nearby medical centers for treatment. Rescue efforts are still on despite ongoing rain in the affected areas,"" said Sammy Mutua, CWS East Africa emergency coordinator.

Andrew Chekonga, a long-time driver with the CWS East Africa regional office and an eyewitness to events in his village, said it was it was devastating to see members of his community buried alive. Three children are among those who were buried alive by mudslides in the area. 

It is very difficult to predict the losses right now,"" Chekonga said. ""The waters have not receded and there is still more rain predicted. It is extremely cold out here and I have counted 165 children and about 335 people totally displaced and living in the open.  They urgently need something to keep themselves warm."" 

Rains are expected to continue through January, officials said.

Anderson Vishalona, a village headman from Chikwawa District, said that floodwaters had already had a severe impact on crops in his area. Farmers who recently applied fertilizer to their maize crops are complaining that the rain waters have washed it off. 

Mafuleka is urging farmers to not apply fertilizers until the heavy rains have subsided and, in the longer term, to opt for crops other than maize that are more resilient. Southern Malawi is prone to seasonal flooding and drought.

Floods could worsen

In Namasalima, a low-lying area of Zomba District, huge tracts of maize fields have been washed away by the floodwaters. Lyness Kasani, 83, is one of about 600 residents in the area whose houses and crops have been damaged. She recalled waking up in the middle of the night to find rainwater cascading down her bedroom wall. ¡°The floor was flooded with water, and I had to use an umbrella throughout the night as my roof gave up and rain poured inside the house,¡± she told IRIN. 

In Nsanje, a low-lying area that also experienced heavy flooding in early 2012, resident Gilbert Kaunda described how he saved a young boy about to be swept away by floodwaters. ¡°He held on to branches, crying, as the waters lifted him up and down till I managed to reach and pull him to safety,¡± he told IRIN. ¡°Had I not been there, he would surely have been swept away by the water.¡±

The flooding has so far resulted in three deaths and significant damage to property and crops. Mafuleka told IRIN that her department is carrying out an assessment to determine more accurately the extent of flood-related damage and the needs of those affected. Displacement and damage
The hardest-hit areas are Phalombe, Mangochi, and Nsanje districts, all in the south of the country and in the same region that, only months ago, had been suffering from too little rain. The resulting poor harvests had left nearly 2 million people without enough food to get them through the lean season, according to an October 2012 assessment by the Malawi Vulnerability Assessment Committee (MVAC).
Now, as heavy rains continue, farmers and officials fear the floodwaters will damage crops and worsen hunger.
In Phalombe, thousands of people have been displaced by flooding, and many have evacuated to makeshift shelters in schools and churches. One school alone is sheltering 1,400 people, according to Davi Chibani, assistant district risk management officer, who is on the ground coordinating rescue and relief efforts. Other temporary camps are sheltering hundreds each. 
Chibani says that if the rains do not subside soon, severe crop damage and another year of poor harvests is likely.

"January 17, 2013:""JAKARTA, Indonesia--Indonesia's army deployed rubber boats in the capital's business district on Thursday to rescue people trapped in floods that inundated much of the city of 14 million people. The president was pictured standing in water up to his shins  his trousers rolled up  at the palace waiting for the arrival of Argentina's leader on a state visit.
The floods were the most widespread to hit Jakarta in recent memory. Authorities said at least four people were killed and 20,000 evacuated. Many more homes were inundated following around five hours of heavy overnight rain that coursed through rivers already swollen by a long monsoon season.
Few areas in the city were spared, from wealthy suburbs to riverside slums and gleaming downtown business blocks. Offices and schools were deserted and traffic ground to a halt. The international airport was operating normally, but travelers were finding it hard to get there.
This is horrible, said Yanitha Damayanti, a bank teller stranded downtown. For the first time in my life, downtown Jakarta has flooded.
The city has long been prone to floods, but successive governments have done little to mitigate the threat.
Deforestation in the hills to the south of the city, chaotic planning and the rubbish that clogs the hundreds of rivers and waterways that crisscross the city are some of the factors behind the floods. The city's vulnerability exposes the country's poor infrastructure even as it has posted impressive economic growth in recent years.

MANILA, Philippines (AP) - At least 43 villagers and soldiers drowned in a southern Philippine town Tuesday when torrents of water dumped by a powerful typhoon cascaded down a mountain, engulfing emergency shelters and an army truck, officials said. The deaths raised the toll from one of the strongest storms to hit the country this year to at least 74.Gov. Arturo Uy said rain from Typhoon Bopha accumulated atop a mountain and then burst down on Andap village in New Bataan town in hard-hit Compostela Valley province. The victims included villagers who had fled from their homes to a school and village hall, which were then swamped by the flash flood. An army truck carrying soldiers and villagers was washed away, according to Uy and army officials.""They thought that they were already secure in a safe area, but they didn't know the torrents of water would go their way,"" Uy told DZBB radio.He said the confirmed death toll in the town was likely to rise because several other bodies could not immediately be retrieved from floodwaters strewn with huge logs and debris.Bopha slammed into Davao Oriental province region at dawn, its ferocious winds ripping roofs from homes and its 500-kilometer (310-mile) -wide rain band flooding low-lying farmland.The storm, packing winds of 140 kilometers (87 miles) per hour and gusts of up to 170 kph (106 mph), toppled trees, triggered landslides and sent flash floods surging across the region's mountains and valleys.Two entire provinces lost power and more than 100 domestic flights were canceled. About 60,000 people fled to emergency shelters.Twenty-three people drowned or were pinned by fallen trees or collapsed houses in Davao Oriental province's coastal town of Cateel, which had the most deaths after New Bataan, Davao Oriental Gov. Corazon Malanyaon told the ABS-CBN TV network, citing police reports.Some towns in the province were so battered that no roofs remained on buildings, Malanyaon said.The other deaths included three children who were buried by a wall of mud and boulders that plunged down a mountain in Marapat village, also in Compostela Valley. Their bodies were wrapped in blankets by their grieving relatives and placed on a stage in a basketball court.""The only thing we could do was to save ourselves. It was too late for us to rescue them,"" said Valentin Pabilana, who survived the landslide.In Davao Oriental, a poor agricultural and gold-mining province about 1,000 kilometers (620 miles) southeast of Manila, an elderly woman was killed when her house was struck by a falling tree, said Benito Ramos, who heads the government's disaster-response agency.The other victims either drowned or were hit by trees, he said, adding that the death toll was expected to rise.While some 20 typhoons and storms normally lash the archipelago nation annually, the southern provinces battered by Bopha are unaccustomed to fierce typhoons, which normally hit the northern and central Philippines.A rare storm last December killed more than 1,200 people and left many more homeless and traumatized, including in Cagayan de Oro city, where church bells pealed relentlessly on Tuesday to warn residents to scramble to safety as a major river started to swell.Officials were taking no chances this year, and President Benigno Aquino III appealed on national TV on Monday for people in Bopha's path to move to safety and take storm warnings seriously."

Cyclone Nilam roared into India's southeastern coast last week, killing at least 15 people in the state of Tamil Nadu and running a large oil tanker aground on the shore near Chennai.
The storm had already been drenching coastal areas with rain as it loitered over the sea north of Sri Lanka before it made landfall. It brought more than a month's rainfall in just a few of days, according to CNN meteorologist Ivan Cabrera.
The ""high impact, long duration"" nature of the downpours ""overwhelmed the rivers and streams"" and led to the disastrous flooding, Cabrera said.
About 70,000 people in Andhra Pradesh, which is north of Tamil Nadu, have been relocated to temporary shelters, Kumar said Tuesday. The flooding has killed 25 people in the state, he said.
The full extent of the damage to crops won't be known until after the flood waters recede, according to authorities.
Tropical cyclones tend to occur in the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea during the April-to-June and September-to-November periods.

"October 29, 2012:""Eastern Cape - Several Eastern Cape municipalities have declared themselves disaster areas following last weeks heavy rain, which resulted in an estimated R1 billion in damage, mostly to roads and infrastructure.

Some of the areas hardest hit said this week they did not have the funds in municipal budgets to deal with the damage from the floods, which claimed at least 12 lives.

Some areas received more than 400mm of rain over just a few days, resulting in roads and bridges washing away, houses and buildings being damaged, and many people being displaced.

Eastern Cape education spokesman Malibongwe Mtima said seven schools, mostly primary schools, had reported being damaged last weekend. Teaching had however continued this week, since the damage had been mostly partial.

The provincial government has started proceedings to declare the province a disaster area, while some municipalities have already made disaster declarations on a local level.

Shane Brown, acting head of safety and security for Nelson Mandela Bay, which includes Port Elizabeth, said damage estimates of between R300 million and R600m had been received.

Most of the damage was on an infrastructural level, including to roads, bridges and stormwater systems.

He said the mayoral committee had recommended that the area be declared a disaster area, but added that this was also being done on a provincial level.

Assistance had been rendered to more than 4 000 people between the start of the rains last week and yesterday morning. Nelson Mandela Bay mayor Zanoxolo Wayile said earlier this week that the impact [of the floods] on the municipal budget will be devastating.

Ted Pillay, municipal manager of the Cacadu district municipality, said five of the nine local municipalities which fall under its control had been severely affected.

The Ndlambe municipality, which includes Port Alfred, Kenton-on-Sea and Bathurst, had been hardest hit, with major damage to roads and municipal and provincial infrastructure. Severe damage to homes in the poorer areas as well as the more affluent areas had been recorded, and those whose homes were flooded, or in some cases flattened, were being housed in community halls.

The Makana municipality, which includes Grahamstown, was next hardest hit, with the majority of damage done to the road network.

Pillay said some homes had experienced some flooding, but that no one was forced from their homes as a result.

In Kouga, which includes Jeffreys Bay and St Francis Bay, the biggest damage was also done to roads. A bridge in St Francis Bay was washed away, leaving residents cut off. ¡°

""hile this is expected to have an overall positive impact on the humanitarian situation in Somalia by contributing to an expected above-average harvest, the short-term consequences that we are witnessing are very serious,"" he added. ""According to the Somalia Water and Land Information Management (SWALIM)¡­ the rains will have the potential to bring suffering to hundreds of thousands of people living around the Shabelle and Juba rivers.

Mitigating measures include closing intentional breaches in riverbanks, which are used to irrigate crops. The service has also warned of possible flooding in other areas of the country, including the town of Jowhar - 90km north of the capital, Mogadishu - where the river level is at ""full crest"", and other riverine towns in the Lower Shabelle Region and in central and northeastern areas of the country.

"September 24, 2012:"" Bentiu ¡ª The Deputy Governor of Unity State, Michael Chiengjiek Geay, says citizens living near the state capital Bentiu will face severe hunger after floods destroyed most farms in the area.Six of the nine counties in the state have reported with poor harvests due to unusually heavy rains since June, according to the official.Geay said he expects that Payinjiar, Mayiandit, Leer, Guit, Parieng, Mayom Countues could experience and Bentui town could face shortages and called upon the citizens in the areas affected to replant their crops as the severe flooding comes to an end.He said authorities are working and observing the situation and the outcome of harvest in October.""e are encouraging those who are heavy affected by floodwater to never give up to replant some crops in their farms after drying"", said Geay. Authorities in the state had already informed the UN agencies to consider the flood victims in their plans to deliver relief assistance in the state. He warned the public to use the resources they have wisely due to the low production this year.In its weekly humanitarian summary the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said that flooding from seasonal rains incidents has been reported in nine of South Sudan's 10 states.The worst affected areas are ""parts of Jonglei, Lakes, Northern Bahr el Ghazal, Unity and Upper Nile.""The OCHA report said that ""most floods so far have not warranted major humanitarian interventions due to their predictable and localized nature. The humanitarian community continues to monitor the situation and conduct rapid needs assessments to determine any need of humanitarian assistance for flood-affected people.""Surveillance of flood-affected counties across South Sudan has been enhanced and an Emergency Flood Task Force has been established by the Ministry of Health. The report adds: ""Access to some flood-affected areas remains limited due to weak infrastructure affected by the heavy rains. In Jonglei and Unity states, assessment missions have been delayed due to insecurity in the areas of the reported flooding.""The UN estimates that 2.4 million people in South Sudan will be food-insecure this year with a total of 4.7 million at risk of food insecurity.Veronica Nyanen Reat, one of the flood victims in Bentui told Sudan Tribune that many people could face starvation if the government and non-governmental organizations did not provide assistance.Unity State has faced numerous challenges since South Sudan halted oil production in January when Juba accused Khartoum of confiscating crude as it passed through northern pipelines.The state, which borders neighbouring Sudan, has also suffered from Khartoum's decision to close the new international border for trade, accusing Juba of backing rebels in South Kordofan.In April Sudanese warplanes bombed the state during a brief conflict over the contested Heglig area.

Transport was devastated as parts of the M6 and the East Coast main line became temporary rivers, and swirling underground water left a block of town houses in Newburn, Newcastle, seemingly on stilts as earth round the foundations was swept away. Police cordoned off the building amid fears it could collapse and last night the area around it was said to be like a ""ghost town"" after a power failure.

An old fishing village in the Footdee or ""Fittie"" area of Aberdeen was covered in a white foam as wind and rain drove a thick froth of plankton and sea-spume inland. The city council said the coating was ""unusual but harmless"" and it would be swept up by environmental teams if any was left after the rain.

An easing of the downpour in the central Pennines, turning to a fine mist by mid-afternoon on Tuesday, saved the centre of Leeds and the much-flooded Calder valley town of Hebden Bridge from serious damage. Sandbags were everywhere in Hebden Bridge and pumps on standby, while emergency teams from the Environment Agency in Leeds ran a round-the-clock clearing of drains and watercourses.

The agency warned, however, that further flooding was likely in Yorkshire, the north-west and north Wales overnight before the obstinate centre of low pressure finally crept off the fells and turned its attention to the Midlands and south. The Meteorological Office warned that their turn would be on Wednesday as the weather backtracked down the course it took over the weekend. There are 219 flood warnings in place.

The yo-yo pattern is the result of two weather systems ¨C a warm front from the Atlantic and a colder one drawn from north of Scotland meeting ¨C and dumping persistent rain. Although some areas have experienced gusts of up to 70mph, the reluctance of the dismal weather to move off north and east is also due to a weaker jetstream than usual at this time of the year.

The Environment Agency has notified 75,000 properties of the serious risk of flooding since Sunday, but in spite of the failure at Morpeth ¨C whose recovery was used as a model for Cockermouth when the Cumbrian town was ravaged by floods three years ago ¨C defences held up well at Ripon, Tadcaster, Dewsbury, Appleby-in-Westmorland ""ther former trouble spots.

"September 26, 2012: ""ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) -- Floodwaters receded Saturday from much of the tourist town of Talkeetna, giving residents a chance to begin cleaning the muddy mess left behind -- but officials warned that the danger hadn't passed and advised that people boil their water.
About 200 miles south, in Cooper Landing on the Kenai Peninsula, the Kenai River had yet to crest and the National Weather Service extended a flood warning until Monday afternoon saying that the river will continue rising. Residents of one subdivision were told to be ready to evacuate.
Forecasters said rain would continue falling Sunday, making it tough to predict how high waterways would rise on the peninsula and when they'll crest.
The outlook seemed a bit better in Talkeetna. Rivers and streams draining from the Talkeetna Mountains had crested and water levels fell steadily Friday night, the weather service said. Meteorologists said they don't expect rainfall to significantly increase river levels there, but a flood warning remained in effect for the area as many waterways remained above flood stage.
The Talkeetna River crested at 15.65 feet on Friday, just below the level considered major flooding. It had receded to 12.5 feet by Saturday afternoon, just above the 12-foot flood mark. Only two streets in Talkeetna remained flooded, the Anchorage Daily News reported (http://bit.ly/UDvlWG).
Talkeetna is the last stop for climbers heading to Mount McKinley, North America's tallest mountain. It also has an eclectic population, and has long been purported to be the inspiration for the Alaska town in the TV series, ""Northern Exposure.""
Longtime residents told the Daily News that flooding was the worst they'd seen in more than 30 years. Still, emergency responders said it could've been worse.
""Luckily, we didn't have any buildings float away,"" said Mike Krepel, who runs the Talkeetna Historical Society Museum with his wife, Jenny.
Krepel used a large pump to drain the museum's flooded first floor.
""It blew its way in pretty quick,"" Krepel said. ""We don't think we lost anything important, but we were going pretty hard for several hours.""
Flooding has caused problems over a wide swath of Alaska this week, from Talkeetna to the port town of Seward, 175 miles to the south.
Department of Transportation crews have been working to protect several bridges on the Glenn Highway from fast-moving water. The road is one of two land routes out of populated areas in Anchorage and Wasilla, and the only one in southern Alaska.
The Alaska Railroad was closed through Wednesday as crews repair tracks and bridges, including a 500-foot stretch that was left dangling when the ground beneath it washed out about 35 miles north of Talkeetna.
The American Red Cross of Alaska has opened three shelters in recent days, and a fourth was opened Saturday at the state fairgrounds in Palmer, about 40 miles northeast of Anchorage, where evacuees could park recreational vehicles.
Gov. Sean Parnell declared a state disaster Friday for communities hard-hit by recent storms. The declaration covers the Kenai Peninsula Borough, which includes Seward, and the Matanuska-Susitna Borough, which includes Talkeetna, Wasilla and several other towns, the governor's office said.
It was too soon to estimate damage and no injuries have been reported.

Just imagine water that has been trapped, about 10 stories high, breaking a barrier and flowing downwards to Abeokuta. You asked what would happen!""What you would have would be a major disaster Just imagine water 10 stories high rushing downwards. It would wipe out everything on its path. That is what would happen should the Oyan Dam collapse and with the way water is being held back by the authorities of the Ogun/Osun River Basin Development Authority, anything can happen"", he warned.The flood management and control expert pointed out that some of the major reasons dams are built are not being addressed by those who should manage the dams.According to Omigbodun, dams are built for purposes of irrigation and power generation, but these dams are not being used for these purposes and the way water is released 'wholesale' makes the ordinarily bad flooding situation worse for Nigerians.He described a similar scenario happening in the north eastern flank of the country where, he said, waters from the Lagdo Dam in Cameroon contribute dangerously to the downward river force of the River Benue.""The waters from the Upper Volta into the River Niger and the waters from the Lagdo Dam in Cameroon which rush into the River Benue, with the confluence at Lokoja, all come downwards to the Niger Delta and the states of the S/South zone.

Despite the use of many pumps and other flood-prevention efforts, floodwater levels rose about 50 centimetres in the economic zones of the province.Officials, as of press time, were still struggling to fill breaks and leaks in the embankment along the Yom River. They initially thought their giant sandbags and gabions would be able to block the water from flowing into the town and causing inundation.
The Provincial Waterworks Authority's Sukhothai branch was flooded and tap-water services to locals were disrupted.
The Yom River also damaged earthen embankments in many other areas of Sukhothai's Sri Samrong and Sawankhalok districts, flooding people living in riverside communities.Schools in seriously flooded areas would be closed down temporarily, officials said.A representative of Princess Ubolratana Rajakanya yesterday visited Sukhothai's Muang district to hand out 500 sets of relief items to flood victims.Deputy Sukhothai Governor Smith Palawatwichai said that during the past week, about 6,000 people in Muang Sukhothai Thani Municipality had been hit by the flooding.In his capacity as head of the Water and Flood Management Committee (WFMC), Science Minister Plodprasob Surassawadee yesterday convened a videoconference with officials and 36 provincial governors.The conference took place after Yingluck received reports that the embankment in Sukhothai had been breached again.""The prime minister is worried about the lives and property of people. So, she has constantly monitored the situation,"" Plodprasob said.He said authorities were taking care of all provinces, not just one particular province.""The government is now fighting not just against natural floods but also against people's fears [about possible flooding],"" Plodprasob lamented. ""We are trying to create public confidence in the government's water-management ability.""Deputy Prime Minister and Interior Minister Yongyuth Wichaidit complained that some media outlets were exaggerating the flood situation, especially in Sukhothai.""In fact, it's not as serious as some newspaper headlines have suggested,"" he said.

According to Plodprasob, authorities have mobilised all resources including the latest technologies in tackling the water-related threats. ""The results of our ongoing battle will come out in a month or two,"" he said, adding, ""I believe the situation will not go beyond our control.""

Hydro and Agro Infomatics Institute director Royol Chitdon, who sits on a WFMC subcommittee, said the volume of water in the Yom River in Sukhothai's Sri Satchanalai district had already dropped from 1,500 cubic metres per second to just 1,200 cubic metres.

"September 5, 2012:  The torrential rains that continue to pounce on scores of villages in the rural Gambia continue to cause severe flooding, thus affecting the livelihoods of the local dwellers. Latest reports reaching this paper have it that heavy floods have destroyed some compounds in Pakau Njogu in the North Bank Region, and many other in Jarra Soma, in the Lower River Region, after more than 24 hours of torrential rains on Saturday.

Reports indicated that nearly 41 people, most of them women and children, have been affected, thus causing temporal displacement without food and proper shelter. The situation has put the entire family of Gibriel Jallow of Pakau Njogu and Muhammed Jawla of Jarra Soma in desperate situations, as they are currently sheltered in the village's nursery school and neighborhoods.

""If the classes remain submerged, how will my son get to school?"" she asked. Her son is set to take the final primary school exam later this year.

Chicken farmer John Ledapana is also assessing his losses after most of his poultry were swept away by the floodwaters, leaving him with only six 3-week-old chicks.

Emergency measures

In Marigat District, two rivers that feed Lake Baringo have breached their banks, overflowing into neighbouring villages. Lake Baringo has extended its banks by up to 1.km, according to the KRCS, which warned that a further 290 families are at risk of displacement if the rains continue.

The agency recommended that the river beds be excavated to improve water retention in the rivers and that dams be constructed upstream to control the volume of water reaching the lake.

According to the KRCS, the affected families are in need of emergency food supplies after at least 26 hectares of maize - which had been ready for harvesting - were destroyed. Fodder, beans and water melon crops have also been ruined.

The delivery of relief items such as medicine, blankets, tents and mosquito nets has been hampered by poor road conditions.

Medical supplies and equipment have also been destroyed by floodwaters in some dispensaries, even as affected populations are threatened by waterborne diseases. ""We can only go to the district hospital in Marigat, but it is hard to raise the 400 Kenya shillings (US$ 4.7) transport expenses,"" said a resident.

South Korea has proposed sending emergency relief aid to North Korea, the first such offer since relations sank into a deep freeze after the death of the North's leader last December.
The South's Red Cross chief sent a proposal on Monday, calling for talks with North Korea on aid shipment, the Unification Ministry, which handles cross-border affairs, said on Friday.
Official aid from the South to the North often goes through the Red Cross as a matter of formality.

South Korea last sent such aid two years ago, although civilian groups have been allowed to ship aid to the impoverished North despite high cross-border tensions.
.

Pyongyang's state news agency said earlier that floods in June and July left 569 people dead or missing and washed away or inundated 65 280 hectares of cropland.

A strong typhoon which hit the Korean peninsula last Tuesday killed 48 people and damaged at least 50 000ha of farmland in the North, it said on Monday.

North Korea suffers chronic food shortages, with the situation exacerbated by floods, droughts and mismanagement. During a famine in the mid to late-1990s, hundreds of thousands died. win typhoons renewed fears of a humanitarian crisis in North Korea, where poor drainage, widespread deforestation and crumbling infrastructure can turn even a routine rainstorm into a catastrophic flood.

Typhoon Bolaven struck the North on Tuesday and Wednesday, submerging houses and roads, ruining thousands of acres of crops and triggering landslides that buried train tracks  scenes that are all too familiar in this disaster-prone nation. A second major storm, Typhoon Tembin, pounded the Korean Peninsula with more rains Thursday before dissipating.

The storms came with North Korea still recovering from earlier floods that killed more than 170 people and destroyed thousands of homes. That in turn followed a springtime drought that was the worst in a century in some areas.

The disaster relief group AmeriCares announced late Thursday that enough emergency antibiotics and medical supplies to treat 15,000 North Koreans would be airlifted to the country as early as this week in coordination with North Korean officials. Damage to 69 hospitals and clinics suffered during the earlier floods has left 700,000 North Koreans without access to health care at a time when scores are fighting off the threat of infection while living in temporary shelters, the group said in a statement.

Other foreign aid groups said they were standing by in Pyongyang, but had not received new requests for help from the North Korean government. They had little information on the extent of damage and were relying on reports from state media. The country¡¯s wariness toward the outside world, as well as a primitive rural road system, means aid may be slow arriving, if it is allowed to come at all.

However, many Krymsk residents believe a discharge of water from the Neberdzhaisk reservoir, south of the town, could have caused the flood, or at least contributed to its strength.The popular hypothesis is that water was released intentionally from the reservoir to prevent water from overflowing into another nearby town.Lev Denisov, head of the laboratory of remote sensing at the Institute of Geography of the Russian Academy of Sciences, has another theory which experts say offers a more probable explanation.The floods force, he said, was caused by water being channelled through small openings in a raised highway south of the city.Using photographs taken from the International Space Station, his team pieced together the path of the floodwater, which he said built up behind a seven-metre-high road embankment south of the town, as well as a raised railway, by late evening on July ""th.The waters were held back by logjams of debris, which temporarily clogged eight narrow bridge openings.¡°When the pressure became too high, the debris clogs burst, unleashing this wall of water,¡± Mr Denisov said.He said the height of the flood water was similar to the height of the highway embankment ¨C seven metres ¨C and dismissed the theory that the floods were caused deliberately.He criticised the construction of the highway and railway, however, which he said should have had wider bridge openings to prevent the build-up of floodwater. ¨C (Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2012)"" informed earlier, the July 7 floods inundated close to 5,000 homes in the Krai¡¯s three cities¡ªGelendzhik, Krymsk, and Novorossiysk¡ªand several villages.

"June 26, 2012: ""(Reuters) - Tropical Storm Debby weakened as it drifted eastward over Florida on Tuesday, dumping more rain on flooded areas and sending thousands of people fleeing from rising rivers.After stalling in the Gulf of Mexico, the storm was finally moving but was expected to take two more days to finish its wet slog across Florida.Emergency managers in Pasco County on Florida's central Gulf Coast ordered a mandatory evacuation for 14,000 to 20,000 people living between the Anclote and Pithlachascotee Rivers. The Anclote rose from 9 feet (2.7 metres) before Debby's approach to more than 27 feet (8.2 metres) on Tuesday, well above major flood level, Pasco County spokesman Eric Keaton saidWater was ankle-deep to head-high in the evacuation area. Emergency crews had to use boats to reach stranded residents in some areas, and 106 Pasco County homes had been damaged.""The city has always been prepared for a water event, but I think Mother Nature woke us up as to how fast she can operate,"" Keaton said.The storm was piling up coastal waters and pushing them inland, preventing the rainwater from draining out to sea.""

Nearly 20 inches (51 cm) of rain has fallen in two days on Wakulla County, a Gulf Coast county famed for its natural springs. Roads were under water in many parts of the surrounding ""Big Bend"" area where the Florida Panhandle meets the peninsula.

Parts of Interstate 10 were closed between the capital, Tallahassee, and the Atlantic coast city of Jacksonville. The storm left 29,000 people without power across the central and northern parts of the state, emergency managers said.

Forecasters at the National Hurricane Centre said Debby could bring another 4 to 8 inches (10 to 20 cm) of rain and possibly tornadoes to north Florida and southeast Georgia in the next two days.

Debby's top winds weakened to 40 miles per hour (65 km per hour), just over the threshold to remain a tropical storm. It was expected to weaken further as the centre moved ashore, but could strengthen back into a tropical storm as it crossed into the Atlantic Ocean, the forecasters said.

The centre of circulation was still in the Gulf of Mexico, about 35 miles (55 km) west-northwest of Cedar Key, Florida. But Debby was a large and ragged storm and most of the thunderstorms and rain were northeast of the centre, already over Florida.

Tropical storm warnings were in effect for much of Florida's Gulf coast and could be extended inland as the storm moves slowly east over the state in the next few days.

Debby spawned twisters that killed a woman, badly injured a child and wrecked homes in central Florida in rural Highlands County on Sunday. Florida's coastal Pinellas County was also hit hard, with flooding in some areas and at least 20 houses with roofs that were partially or fully blown off during a tornado-like storm."

"July 16, 2012: ""(Reuters) - India's annual monsoon has claimed 109 lives since rains started in June and left at least 400,000 people homeless in the northeastern state of Assam, in a tragedy experts say was made worse by corruption and poor management of the Brahmaputra River. A senior member of the Assam Human Rights Commission, a government body, told Reuters it suspects millions of dollars meant for flood control have been siphoned off by state water department officials in the last five years. The commission has demanded a high-level investigation by the government. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, who represents Assam in the upper house of parliament, called the floods the worst in recent times and promised $1,800 to each victim's family in compensation. Critics say that much of the money will evaporate.""Corruption is rampant before and after a flood,"" said Arup Misra, a prominent environmental activist in the state and a professor at Assam Engineering College. ""Some officials eagerly wait for floods as they could make money on repairing of embankments and relief distribution.""Over the past 60 years successive governments have built levees along most of the length of the volatile Brahmaputra, which is Assam's main river and is fed by Himalayan snow melt and some of the world's heaviest rainfall. Experts say these embankments are both criminally under-maintained and a discredited form of flood management.Assam is famed as a tea-growing region and rich in oil and timber. It is also home to the Kaziranga National Park that hosts two-thirds of the world's Great One-horned Rhinoceroses.LEVEE BREACH DESTROYS HOMESNearly a decade ago, Hannan Sikdar's father lost his home and farm to floods in Assam. On June 28, the same fate struck Sikdar and his family of 10 when the Brahmaputra burst through a dike and swept away their home and everything they owned in the middle of the night.Assam's population is on the rise, and like millions of others, Sikdar lived in a danger zone right next to the river's mud embankment. Millions of dollars were assigned to keep levees in good shape. But in eight years living there, Sikdar says nobody even came to talk about the risks.""This was the place where we made our home when my father lost his property several years ago,"" said the 30-year-old, looking down at the wreckage of his bamboo and wood house from a new makeshift hut further along the embankment.""We were never told that this embankment could break.""Rajiv Sinha, an expert on river dynamics, said the levees prevent the river from spreading silt in its natural flood plain, causing the river to clog up and increasing the frequency and intensity of floods. Similar embankments downstream in Bangladesh have also been blamed for devastating flooding.""In the last fifty years, two things have happened -- the expenditure on flood control has increased tremendously, and at the same time the damage caused by floods has also increased exponentially,"" said Sinha, who teaches geosciences at the Indian Institute of Technology in Kanpur.Globally, flood management trends are moving away from levee-type measures to natural storage areas such as swamps and wetlands. But Assam has failed to come up with any modern, long-term plan to harness the river.Entire villages, such as the one Sikdar belonged to, have cropped up in flood-prone areas and their only layer of protection is a neglected, crumbling mud wall.As heavy rains continue, officials fear a second spell of floods soon, but victims such as Hanan Sikdar continue to live in tiny straw and tin shelters next to the broad river.""People are living in danger zones out of compulsion,"" said Chandan Talukdar relief worker with Sikdar. ""Till alternative land is found, these people will remain on embankments"" .July 9, 2012:  Assam on Monday reeled under the impact of floods with the Brahmputra and its tributaries playing havoc in 27 districts of the state affecting nearly 24 lakh people and taking the death toll to 124.

The rains that pounded the area for about six hours swept away desks and books in schools and beds and other equipment at the district hospital.Bute ward councillor Mohamed Ibrahim said the rains displaced families after sweeping through low-lying Uran settlement and the old town. Bute town is located beneath mountains. The civic leader said the floods submerged or swept away the traditional houses.Majority of those displaced by the flash floods are now living with relatives as they wait for their houses to dry or get alternative areas to relocate to.

"October 26, 2011: ""Rivers of muddy water poured into the narrow cobbled streets and piazzas of the five villages known as the Cinque Terre ('Five Lands'), on a spectacular stretch of the coast of Liguria, earlier this week. The tiny ports of Vernazza and Monterosso, which attract hundreds of thousands of tourists a year, were swamped by hundreds of tonnes of debris and mud. The flooding and mudslides, which killed seven people in Liguria and neighbouring Tuscany, were caused by 20 inches of torrential rain falling in just a few hours on Tuesday and Wednesday. But environmentalists said its impact was made much worse by unchecked construction along the coastline, which lies east of Genoa.

Around 500 soldiers were drafted in to help with clearance efforts and to search for people still listed as missing, amid fears that the death toll could rise. The floods washed away roads and closed the railway line which connects the five villages, meaning they could only be reached by sea. Cars were piled on top of each other by the force of the water, locals and tourists had to be evacuated by sea, and villages were left without gas, electricity and water. Renata Briano, a local official, said Vernazza had been hit by ""a mountain of mud"".

Nalgae swept out into the South China Sea after a six-hour daytime rampage on the main island of Luzon, but disaster management chief Benito Ramos said millions of people remained in danger.""The fight is not over yet,"" he said, explaining that the rain-soaked Cordillera mountains, in the typhoon's direct path, which have a population of about three million, now faced the threat of landslides.Meanwhile, he said up to eight million people in the central Luzon plains, located between Cordillera and Manila, faced much worse floods than the earlier destruction caused by typhoon Nesat, which had followed the same path.""I hope the (Nesat) floods will wash out to Manila Bay before the (Nalgae) runoff hits the area,"" Mr Ramos said. ""If the latter catches up with the former, there won't be any rooftops left to see above the floodwaters,"" he said, repeating an earlier appeal for people to leave all inundated areas.The weather service's flood forecasting section said water levels on the tributaries of major central Luzon rivers were rising fast. These could bring floods to the 150km-long central Luzon floodplain.Mr Ramos said there was now less danger from the equally vast Cagayan River basin in the northeast because residents of vulnerable areas had left ahead of Nalgae's approach, though he said he did not know the exact number of evacuees.His agency listed 180,000 evacuees, mostly victims displaced by Nesat.The only death so far caused by Nalgae was from a landslide that struck a van near the northern mountain town of Bontoc, Mr Ramos said.He said it was still too dangerous for his people to go out to assess the extent of the damage in other areas. ""I don't want them getting hit with flying roofing sheets,"" he said.Packing wind gusts of up to 195km/h, Nalgae caused widespread disruption to domestic shipping, aviation and power supply, the disaster agency said.Meanwhile, the death toll from Nesat has risen to 52, with 31 fishermen still missing.Among those holding out against the floods is Ida de la Cruz, a 37-year-old farmer's wife, who had yesterday sought refuge on her rooftop in Pulilan, a town of 70,000 people an hour's drive north of Manila.""We can't leave our 15 ducks as most of our income comes from the eggs that they lay,"" she said while washing clothes using the murky brown floodwaters.Nearby, dozens of families huddled in heavy rain under tarpaulin tents pitched on the side of the highway, an isolated part of Pulilan not engulfed by water.Robert Pagdanganan, a former minister in the previous government, said the flooding that swept through four other nearby towns - including his house - was the worst he could remember.""The problem is there's really nowhere to go,"" he said.""They (local officials) are trying their best, but the evacuation centres are also flooded.""..Flooding in Central Luzon areas affected by Typhoon Pedring may take three more days before subsiding, the head National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (NDRRMC) said on Sunday.¡°This may take two or three more days,""said NDRRMC executive director and concurrent Office of Civil Defense administrator Benito Ramos, who conducted an ocular inspection of the affected areas earlier in the day.¡°The weather condition has improved, but the problem is compounded by the high tide, causing the slow receding of the floodwaters,""Ramos added.As of Sunday night, the towns of Calumpit and Hagonoy in Bulacan province; and Apalit, Lubao, Minalin, Sasmuan, and Candaba all in Pampanga were still flooded.The flooding was worsened when authorities ordered the release of water from dams in anticipation of typhoon Quiel last Saturday.

In recent years it has also experienced flooding due to torrential rains""ollapsed buildings, flooded-out rice paddies: the floods in Niger are not as spectacular as those in Pakistan, but they spell disaster for a people already stricken by a food crisis.Zarmagandaye, Lamorde and Karadje are three districts of the west African country's capital Niamey which have turned into marshland since the beginning of August.Under the ruins of homes built of clay, cats gnaw on the bodies of dead grey lizards, while a handful of children come to splash around in the deserted streets.On Monday, torrential rain brought down the few buildings still left upright three weeks after the Niger river, the third biggest in Africa, burst its banks in the worst recorded floods since 1929.""The bustling districts have now turned into ghost towns, we've never seen the like in living memory,"" Abdou Ganda, an elderly fisherman, said.The United Nations has registered more than 17,000 homeless people in the capital. Only half of them, currently sheltered in schools, have received food, blankets and mosquito nets provided by international organisations.The Niamey-based Niger Basin Authority (ABN), which groups the nine nations crossed by the river and its tributaries, attributes the rise in the river's level to exceptionally heavy rain in neighbouring states such as Mali and Burkina Faso.""We made little of the rising water level and were surprised in our sleep,"" said Mariama, a widow with nine children who lost everything when their home collapsed.According to Niger's Early Warning System (SAP) and catastrophe management officials, the whole of the country, including the perenially arid desert of the northern Agadez region, has been affected by flooding caused by heavy rain.The SAP and UN agencies have estimated that almost 200,000 people have no homes in the eight regions of Niger, where at least seven people have died since the start of the catastrophe, according to media reports.""It's a double catastrophe: before the rain, the people lacked food, now the few reserve stocks of cereal have been washed away by the water. There's nothing left,"" said Ibrahim Mahaman, a village chief cited by the Oxfam aid organisation.More than seven million people in Niger face food shortages in a serious crisis because of a major shortfall in the crop harvest for 2009-2010, according to the UN.In Niamey, while the floodwaters are gradually pulling back, the meteorological office has forecast heavy rain until mid-September.""it"
"August 28, 2011: ""Dangerous, damaging floodwaters emerged Sunday night as one of the biggest threats from Irene, which impacted millions with its strong winds and drenching rains over its three-day run up the East Coast. The storm, which was a hurricane for days before weakening to tropical storm status earlier Sunday, was blamed for at least 19 deaths across seven states. The U.S. government estimated that the cost from wind damage alone is expected to top $1 billion, with downed power lines leaving more than 4 million people without electricity. ""I want people to understand that this is not over,"" President Barack Obama said Sunday evening from Washington. ""The impacts of this storm will be felt for some time, and the recovery effort will last for weeks or longer."" Some of the biggest, continuing headaches related to flooding, as tidal storm surges and overflowing, fast-moving rivers left homes in North Carolina and points northward awash. Flood warnings and watches were in effect Sunday night for much of New Jersey, Pennsylvania, eastern New York, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Vermont, New Hampshire and Maine. Numerous ""swift-water"" rescue teams were dispatched Sunday night around Vermont, where state emergency management spokesman Mark Bosma said some small towns were ""entirely covered with water"" and people, including a woman who was in labor, were stranded in schools and cars. Vermont State Police Capt. Ray Keefe said that Wilmington is ""cut off,"" hundreds of roads had been closed, and some homes were washed off foundations and into lakes. And ""conditions continue to worsen dramatically"" in Vermont's capital of Montpelier, city manager William Fraser said Sunday night, noting National Weather Service warnings of rising river waters that will cause ""major flooding"" downtown early Monday morning. ""The conditions today have been awful,"" Bosma said. ""Water is pretty much everywhere."" Also hard-hit was New Jersey, where initial fears about coastal flooding -- which had prompted the evacuation of more than 1 million people from the shore -- had given way to fresh concerns about inland flooding. That left many residents like Guy Pascarello, whose family's Secaucus home of 40 years was declared uninhabitable after it became inundated by three-foot-high waters, trying to figure out what to do next. ""I don't know (what we'll do), this is all new ground,"" Pascarello said. ""The good news is that it's just stuff. This is a home and we love our home, but it's just things."" Even locations well inland, like Princeton Junction about halfway between New York City and Princeton, had waters as high as 12 feet that covered roads and bridges, resident Edward Picco said. And streets in downtown Millburn saw major flooding when the Rahway River overflowed early Sunday morning, said Lt. Peter Eakley, the town's deputy emergency management coordinator. ""It's crazy. ... The water is moving between buildings, up, down, all sorts of different directions,"" Rich Graessle told CNN's iReport from Millburn.Along the shore in Long Beach, New York, water poured underneath the boardwalk and into the city's downtown. Outside Philadelphia, meanwhile, waters climbed to street-sign levels in Darby, Philadelphia Mayor Michael Nutter said, with the water sending ""couches, furniture, all kinds of stuff floating down the street."" Two buildings collapsed in Philadelphia, Nutter told reporters, but no one was injured. One family paid tribute to the storm by naming their child, born at 12:01 a.m. Sunday, Manuel Hurricane Cooper, said Riddle Hospital spokeswoman Bridget Therriault in Media, Pennsylvania, just outside Philadelphia. Those living around the Gilboa Dam in upstate New York, about 50 miles southwest of Albany, were told to evacuate Sunday afternoon due to concerns that the dam could be overwhelmed by ""higher-than-predicted amounts of rain."" Further south in New York City, officials worked Sunday night to return the city to normal. Hours earlier, the Hudson River overflowed in lower Manhattan, receding only after massive amounts of water spilled over jogging paths and into at least one nearby apartment building. Water also lapped over the banks of the city's East River and onto Orchard Beach and Yankee Stadium parking lots in the Bronx. There were no reports of deaths, though firefighters did help evacuate dozens from flooded homes in areas of Staten Island due to neck-deep water, the New York City Fire Department said.Lines on the Metro-North system flooded, eroding tracks and causing significant damage, said Metropolitan Transit Authority chief Jay Walder. But as inspections and clean-up continued, the system -- which was shut down at noon Saturday -- took its first steps to returning with the resumption of some bus services at 4:30 p.m. Sunday. In addition, the Federal Aviation Administration announced that the area's three major airports -- Newark Liberty in northern New Jersey and LaGuardia and John F. Kennedy in the New York City boroughs of Queens -- will reopen Monday, two days after they shut down. ""All in all, we are in pretty good shape because of the exhaustive steps, I think, we took to prepare for whatever comes our way,"" Mayor Michael Bloomberg said. It's all due to a storm that first made landfall at 7:30 a.m. Saturday in North Carolina, then paralleled the coast, and slammed into Little Egg Inlet, New Jersey, as a Category 1 hurricane around 5:30 a.m. Sunday, said the National Hurricane Center said.By 8 p.m., Tropical Storm Irene had maximum sustained winds of 50 mph and was nearing the U.S.-Canadian border, the center reported. according to the center.One woman is ""feared dead"" in Vermont after being swept away in raging waters in Wilmington, said Bosma. In addition, officials have reported six deaths in North Carolina, four in Virginia, four in Pennsylvania and one each in Connecticut, Maryland and Florida, two in New Jersey.And as the governor of Virginia, parts of which saw 16 inches of rain and top winds clocked at 83 mph, warned Sunday that more bad news may be coming. ""Undoubtedly, there will be more reports of damage, of injuries, perhaps fatalities,"" Gov. Bob McDonnell told reporters. Flanking Obama during his afternoon statement, FEMA director Craig Fugate vowed Sunday that authorities will work with those impacted by the wind, rain, storm surge and resulting flooding. ""When the disaster comes off the news and no one is paying attention, we still don't go home,"" he said. ""We know we've got a lot of work ahead of us."""

Sinha, adding that about 70,000 people were homeless and around 300,500 hectares of mainly rice paddy had been destroyed"" August 25, 2011: ""In Bihar, two and a half days of floods have been turned into a two-and-a-half-month-long affair so that the politics over relief continues, says one of India's leading river researchers.Solutions to tackle the recurring 'man-made' floods lie in a dialogue between the residents of flood-prone plains, the technical fraternity and the government, says Dinesh Kumar Mishra.'They have turned two and a half days of floods into a two and a half months' floods so that the politics over relief continues. Flood is a man-made menace,' Mishra, who was in the city to address a seminar 'Dying Rivers, Living Rivers' at the India International Centre, told IANS.A structural engineer from the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT)-Kharagpur, Mishra has written volumes probing the origin of the Kosi, Bagmati, Mahananda and Bodhi Balan rivers and man-made floods in them caused by breaches in embankments.Currently writing a book about the origin and flow of the Gandak, Mishra's work on the Kosi, 'Trapped! Between the Devil & Deep Waters: The Story on Bihar's Kosi River', remains his seminal investigation.Citing examples from Bihar, which has eight major Himalayan rivers and is ravaged by floods every year, Mishra said that studies reveal that people living in the lowlands of Bihar, on an average, suffer for 20 days in a year.'For the rest of the year, they have a nice, flood-free life. Women do not have to walk for miles with pitchers on their heads for drinking water. There is enough ground water in their courtyard. But no one takes note of that.''If water or floods were the problem, then people could not have lived for centuries in harmony with rivers. But, instead of living with rivers on equal terms, people are now empowering the rivers (in the name of taming it) with the more destructive embankments and big dams,' Mishra said.Any dam or embankments on the rivers should be designed to meet indigenous needs, he said.'In Bihar, residents classify floods into five categories. 'Barh' - in which water spills on the embankment, 'Boah', - when the rivers swamps large areas, 'Humma' - when water half submerges the cattle, 'saah'- when the flood water churns in ripples; and 'pralay' - destruction.'People of the state are used to 'barh' and 'boah'; while the other three are rare,' he said.Probing the dynamics of flood relief politics, he said that earlier, the king used to disburse relief during inundation to 'save his own skin'.'Later, the bureaucrats swindled money for relief. Aid has now been a tool to win elections,' he said.Tracing Bihar's historical relationship with the Kosi, he said those living in the lowlands deify the river by calling it 'maiya (mother)'.In 2008, it however became a terror. A breach in the Kosi embankment in Nepal in 2009 inundated large tracts in adjoining Bihar, affecting more than three million people in 16 districts.'For centuries, the residents have worshipped the rivers. But the outsiders who came there (especially the British) could not adjust to the nature of the Kosi and the Damodar. Hence they became rivers of sorrow because the colonisers and the subsequent government could not collect revenue from it,' Mishra said.'Till 1952, the British rulers and their successors had been creating embankments for commercial purposes so that the river did not come to the villages. That created a need for irrigation and opportunity for revenue. They collected revenue for flood protection too,' he said.An estimate by the Bihar government says the eight rivers of the state have breached their embankments 371 times since 1987.The benefits of embankment are very limited, Mishra argued.'The mud (and later concrete) embankments put the rivers between two walls, prevented them from spilling sediments on its banks and disturbed the water balance with confinement. Tributaries could not join the main rivers. They either flowed parallel to the main river and flowed back to the countryside dissipating into a network of channels demanding construction of sluice gates to control the backflow,' he said.The premise is that the sluice gates will remain open during rainy season, but then they don't function and this traps the tributaries.Offering solutions, Mishra said the natural drainage of the river should not be disturbed as far as possible. 'Rivers are known to flow for benefits; they should not be allowed to stagnate,' he said.(Madhusree Chatterjee can be contacted at madhu.c@ians.in)"".August 22, 2011: "" Floods in Bihar have left nearly 1.5 million people in 12 districts struggling to survive under open skies, according to Special Secretary Sunil Kumar of the Disaster Management Department, even as state Chief Minister Nitish Kumar undertook an aerial survey for the second consecutive day.The department said that flood waters had entered more than 1,000 villages in 500 panchayats and rising level of most rivers threatened to inundate many others. The affected villages were in the districts of Bhagalpur, Muzaffarpur, Gopalganj, Munger, Begusarai, Katihar, Araria, Purnia, Saharsa, Darbhanga, Madhepura and Saran.¡°The floods have badly hit Bhagalpur district,¡± an official said.

In An Giang Province, rising waters broke through four dykes in Cho Moi, Tan Thanh and Chau Phu early today and late yesterday, leaving more than 2,720 ha of rice under water. Vo Thanh Phu, chairman of the Chau Phu District People's Committee, said the district had nearly 1,300 ha of rice inundated. In addition, more than 400km of dykes in the district were threatened by floods, he said. Huynh The Nang, deputy chairman of the An Giang People's Committee, said 4,000 ha of rice were inundated in An Giang so far. The Tien and Hau rivers, the two main tributaries of the Mekong, have been rising fast in recent days due to high tides and floods in the upper Mekong.In An Giang Province, the Tien rose to 4.75 metres, 0.25 meter above the third warning level at the Tan Chau Station on Wednesday, while the Hau rose to 4.11 metres, 0.1 metre above the third warning level at Chau Doc Station. In Dong""Thap Province, a 30-meter section of the Ca Mui dyke in Tan Hong District's Tan Thanh A Commune was breached on Wednesday, flooding more than 520 ha of rice. Tan Hong People's Committee mobilised thousands of peoples and facilities to reinforce the dyke, but surging floodwaters still overwhelmed the dyke due to its weak foundations. Five other important dykes in Tan Hong that protect more than 3,500 ha of rice are threatened by the floods, according to the district People's Committee. As of Wednesday, more than 1,090 hectares of rice in Kien Giang Province were inundated, with nearly 400 ha destroyed. Kien Giang Province's Department of Agriculture and Rural Development has provided support of VND9 billion to farmers in Giong Rieng, Tan Hiep, Chau Thanh and Go Quao districts to pump water out of their rice fields.

The burden of such losses weighs heavily on the families of Moha Khnhoung commune, in Kampong Chams Koh Sotin districtOne of the victims was two-year-old Phoung Sambath, the only child of a horse-cart driver living in Khpob village. Phoung Nam lost his son on Sunday after he drowned in the floodwaters near the steps of their home. Phoung Nam spoke to the Post on Wednesday, surrounded by neighbours and relatives in a friends home that could only be reached by wading through waist-deep water.I miss my son. I keep imagining past times I spent with him, said the 31-year-old father, whose wife left the family in April to move to Phnom Penh. I lived with my son and now I am alone & I do not know what the future holds for me, Phoung Nam said.When he found out, he cried, he hit the ground, he hugged his sons body, relatives of the man told reporters.A modest funeral was held for the child on the same day he died.  Phoung Nam could not afford any new clothing for the child to be buried in, but neighbours pitched in.  Others in the village, which sits on the banks of the Mekong River, suffered property damage and crop loss in the floods which hit the area on Friday and only began to subside on Tuesday.By Wednesday, many of the houses in the village were still surrounded by about a foot of water and some of the roads were impassable. Rice paddies turned to impromptu fishing grounds, as farmers cast their nets into the chest-high water. The Mekong coursed by, high above its banks thanks to heavy rains in Laos and Thailand, forcing the commuter ferry to dock just shy of the villages main thoroughfare, where residents were counting the cost of the damage. Villager Mao Lalin, 31, may have been lucky compared to some neighbours: the flooding spared his home. But it destroyed the morning glory he grew in the backyard for sale in his village.I have lost more than a fifth of my income because of the flooding, he said.Within the last few years the flooding has never been as bad this, said village chief Peang Nhen, 61, adding that the boy was the first person to be killed in the village by flooding since 1993. High river water, which inundated around five hectares of rice in the village, also came unseasonably early this year. It usually doesnt begin until September, Pheang Nhen explained. If the rice fields are destroyed, we will have to replant.Communities across Kampong Cham province are picking up the pieces left by the receding floodwaters. About 25 kilometers away, in the Chirou I commune of Tbong Khmum district, flooding forced the evacuation of 69 families from Prek Toch village alone, said village chief Ly Sarith. Tolas Mab, a 70-year-old resident, said he had been forced to stay with relatives for six days after his home was inundated with floodwaters. ¡°Villagers who own cattle have evacuated to a safer place ¡­ and some others are living in their boat"" he said, adding that the flooding had caused corn, potato, and cassava plantations in the village to rot.

Residents jostled with police on Monday and Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra ordered that the gate be opened by a meter (three feet).But city authorities warned that the flow through the gate could move via a major canal into large parts of the city which are now dry.""We are opposed to it but the government has ordered the BMA to open the gate, so more water will come,"" said Bangkok Metropolitan Authority (BMA) spokesman Jate Sopitpongstorn.""It could reach the Bang Chan industrial estate. We have to see the consequences,"" he told Reuters, adding that residents of the area had been told to be on alert.Yingluck's government and the Bangkok authority represent opposing factions in Thailand's strife-plagued politics.An expert from the government flood management team played down the danger to inner Bangkok of opening the sluice gate, saying the flow was relatively small compared with the amount coming in through leaks in the city's dikes.""Inner Bangkok is not so much an issue,"" said academic Anon Sanitiwong Na Ayutthaya. ""At least we know what to do, it's just a matter of time to fix the leaks.""The disaster has been the first big test for the government of Yingluck, the younger sister of former premier Thaksin Shinawatra, who was ousted in a 2006 coup.Yingluck, a political novice, took over this year after an election that many Thais hoped would heal divisions that triggered street violence last year.Saving central Bangkok from a ruinous flood would be an important victory. The city's 12 million people account for 41 percent of Thailand's gross domestic product.But prolonged misery in outlying areas and heavily flooded provinces to the north would take the gloss off any victory for Yingluck, especially given a perception that those areas have been sacrificed to save the capital.To the north of Bangkok, Pathum Thani and Ayutthaya provinces have been largely inundated for weeks, along with seven industrial estates that have sprung up over the last two decades on what used to be the central plain's rice fields.""BE PREPARED""People eked out a living in the flooded provinces on Tuesday with women cooking over gas stoves in the shade of plastic sheets strung up over pick-up trucks while men in their underwear cast fishing nets into water covering roads. Cars, trucks and taxis were bumper to bumper for about 20 km (12 miles) on an elevated road out of Bangkok, parked and abandoned safely above the murky tide. The cabinet met to work out a recovery plan that one cabinet minister said this week could cost up to $30 billion, including an overhaul of the water-management system and rehabilitation of industrial estates. Deputy Prime Minister and Commerce Minister Kittirat Na Ranong said the government would need to borrow ""hundreds of billions of baht"" to recover and prevent a repeat of disaster during the annual rainy season. ""Any investor, ambassador, I talk to, they never ask how high the floodwaters are but what will Thailand actually do to prevent this from happening again,"" Kittirat told reporters. The government would invite experts from inside and outside the country to help draw up the plan and he would approach the Asian Development Bank to discuss financing. ""We have to be prepared for the future,"" Kittirat said. ""Preparation and the prevention of floods and drought is something we must start to do now."" Yingluck said on Monday she had assured Japanese investors there would be no repeat of the disaster. The government expects it will take three months to get the flooded industrial estates back on their feet. Thailand is the second-largest exporter of computer hard drives and global prices are rising because of a flood-related shortage of major components used in personal computers. Thailand is also Southeast Asia's main auto-parts maker and Japan's Honda Motor Co said car production could be difficult in the second half of its business year ending in March. Its Ayutthaya plant has suspended work indefinitely. The Bank of Thailand has nearly halved its projection of economic growth this year to 2.6 percent from July's 4.1 percent estimate, and said the economy -- Southeast Asia's second largest -- would shrink by 1.9 percent in the December quarter from the previous three months due to the floods. Headline inflation rose to 4.19 percent in October from 4.03 percent the previous month as the flooding pushed up some prices but the central bank said the rises were temporary and it would focus on longer-term factors in setting policy. The floods submerged four million acres (1.6 million ha), an area roughly the size of Kuwait, and destroyed 25 percent of the main rice crop in the world's largest rice exporter. The deluge was caused in part by unusually heavy monsoon rain but the weather has been mostly clear for the past week. The BMA said 2,245 mm (more than seven feet) of rain had fallen this year to the end of October, 40.8 percent above average.

The city is particularly vulnerable, because many areas sit less than 2 metres above sea level. Already, pockets of the city have been submerged, with 17 locations flooded over the weekend as a result of heavy rainfall. Flood levels of 30-40 centimetres were reported at one location in the city.The National Disaster Warning Centre warned that nine canals in the capital, already near capacity levels, were likely to break their banks, while 13 districts and eastern zones outside flood barriers were likely to be flooded.High tides beginning this week could exacerbate the flooding, with fears that the Chao Phraya River, which runs through central Bangkok, will break its banks. Authorities are installing up to 400 water pumps along the river and digging canals to divert flood waters.Over the weekend, there were chaotic scenes and frantic evacuations in the ancient city of Ayutthaya, 80 kilometres upriver from Bangkok. The inner city island, where historical sites are located, was inundated after the water broke through the flood walls in many areas. Among those evacuated were some 2,000 patients from the provincial hospital.Residents and rescuers waded through waist- and chest-high water, hopping on trucks and boats, and moving to higher ground with whatever few belongings they could extricate. Journalist Simon Roughneen, reporting from Ayutthaya, wrote: All day, groups of people have been clambering onboard dinghies, rafts and impromptu vessels cobbled together from truck tyre tubes, styrofoam boardsanything at all that floats.Back outside the citys hospital, Thai Red Cross volunteer Pipath Cheangnoi says he was asked by government officials to help co-ordinate the evacuation of more than 2,000 patients trapped inside the buildingan effort that was ongoing as darkness fell amid dangerous conditions with electricity down or unusable, and strong currents swirling in places around the hospital gates.Roughneen spoke to one relieved mother whose 5-year-old daughter had just been saved by rescuers who pushed through chest-high water to reach her after she was trapped upstairs by an overnight rush of water. I was scared, worried. I still am, but thanks to these helpers I have my Sililak safe, Thanarat Yui Panomai said.The government has discussed possible evacuation measures for Bangkok, but with flood waters bearing down on the city of over 12 million, it is a case of too little, too late. Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra told the media: We are rushing to drain water and evacuate people before the seawater peaks. We dont know how much rain will fall when the new storms arrive. We cant protect every area.The floods have also destroyed infrastructure, and paralysed economic life in parts of the country. More than 200 roads have been damaged, including the Asian highway, the main route to northern Thailand. The gross domestic product (GDP) growth forecast for this year has been scaled down from 4.4 percent to 3.6 percent as a result.Almost 200 factories, including a Honda plant and electronics and car parts facilities, were closed in Ayutthaya, after the Rojana industrial park was inundated. Its a crisis there now, Industry Minister Wannarat Charnnukul told Bloomberg.com on Saturday. There is nothing we can do because the water level is higher than the barriers.There are fears that the floods, which extend across South East Asia, will further drive up food prices. The Thai farm ministry announced last week that the main rice harvest would be down 12 percent, with over 3 million tonnes possibly damaged by the floods. Thailand is the world¡¯s biggest rice exporter, accounting for around 30 percent of exports.The floods threaten a political crisis for the Puea Thai-led coalition government, which was elected in July following a populist camp""gn that fraudulently appealed to the aspirations of the rural and urban poor.In a nationally televised address on October 7, Prime Minister Yingluck said: We have to admit that this is more serious than in the past& The government is just a little more than a month old and it is difficult to cope with the situation because the volume of water is so high. Earlier, Yingluck commented that the government was at its wits end because of the flooding.Since taking office, the government has been under pressure from business circles in Thailand and internationally to drop its election promises.

Employer representative Atthayuth Leeyavanija, a member of Thailands central wage-setting committee, warned against implementing a promised pay rise, saying: Raising wages to 300 baht a day nationwide would have a severe impact on businesses.Whilst the floods are a natural phenomenon, their devastating impact has been exacerbated by long-term government policies that have subordinated public safety to the profits of loggers and property developers.National Disaster Warning Centre director Captain Somsak Khaosuwan has publicly stated that the severity of the floods was a product of poor logistics and rampant deforestation. The Bangkok Post quoted him saying: ¡°It used to be villagers had four to five days to prepare, but nowadays flooding can hit the same day as the warning¡­ There are no forests t""bsorb the water.¡±Somsak said natural water reservoirs that prevented flooding in the past no longer existed due to building and property development: ¡°The way we build our roads and urban areas, we don¡¯t consider the natural flow of water. Often we build things directly in its path. Many villages are built right in the path of the water.¡± He added: ¡°There are people who believed that their villages would not be flooded because they have never been flooded from the days of their parents and grandparents¡­ But things have changed.¡±The flood crisis has exacerbated social tensions, with the Bangkok Post reporting violent clashes between residents in wet areas, angry at those""in dry areas.

"August 8, 2011: ""The July 10, 2011 heavy rain has come and gone leaving behind loss of billions worth of property, death and soil erosion. The heavy rain affected Lagos, Ogun and Oyo states.Residents of Benin City, Edo State are no strangers to flooding as it is commonplace that heavy rainfall comes with flood. Flood also affected some parts of Taraba State. Flood is our own tsunami or hurricane, though could have been managed without any problem.Flood has only reminded us that the government, be it in Lagos, Ogun or elsewhere, is not addressing the root of our under-development. The recent flood has taught us that sustainable development goes beyond constructing just few roads, bridges and planting flowers on few major roads and go to sleep. In fact, Lagos, like other parts of the country, is moving at a reverse speed. My heart goes out to those who lost their loved ones and also those who lost properties.Different reasons have been adduced to the cause of the damage while some have ignorantly stated that what happened was natural and could not have been otherwise. Governor Babatunde Fashola's response to the flooding is the usual martial order. Fashola had stated that some identified buildings on drainages and refuse dumping in drainages were responsible for the flooding and as such they will be demolished. On the surface, it may look reasonable because there are some houses built on drainages while many have been filled with refuse.However, these reasons are not the root cause of flood, they are just consequences of lack of planning. Where was the same government when these houses were erected on drainages? No one should lose sight of the fact that the flood also affected highbrow areas like Lekki, Victoria Island and Ikoyi.Besides, many of the drainages and canals were not properly built and have overtime degenerated to the extent that they could not properly serve their purposes; most of the canals have been silted and overgrown with plants; drainages have been filled with refuse and sand. Simply, flood could be caused by heavy rainfall that can force the river or ocean to over flow its banks. The recent flood in Lagos was not as a result of overflow of the Atlantic Ocean but by a heavy downpour with inadequate or poor drainage system.Lagos, just like Ibadan and Port Harcourt, is densely populated. The more population increases, the more the challenges of basic infrastructures. Lagos, like other parts of Nigeria, was never planned in a holistic manner. Planning means every area of life is put into consideration when putting and expanding basic infrastructures.When houses were built without putting into consideration a central water system, a central sewage, electricity, drainages, canals, roads, bridges, pipelines, rail lines, dams etc, there is bound to be a problem. In the last 30 years, new areas have been developed in Lagos with no corresponding basic infrastructures, like drainages, roads, canals, etc.Until we recognise that each house or drainage in one street is part of a whole community/city/town there is bound to be disaster. The level of physical development today is largely as a result of self-help or private investment. For example, Mr. A builds his house without considering the environmental impact in terms of what is best for the locality and to others in the community. He is in a race to create a blind alley such as others.A planned society takes into account effective channels of waste water from a building to drainage linking possibly to bigger drainage or floodways and to a canal or dam. And all the drainages, canals, roads etc, must be built to live up to the challenges of a low, high land and the environment in its entirety. When a country leaves everybody to build his or her house, possibly drainages and roads, it is encouraging a state of anarchy!""

But the controlled resulting flow of water onto farmland has been slower than the Manitoba government had planned.Officials estimate the flood will cover up to 72 square miles (180 square km) of land over the next few days, down from the 90 square miles they had estimated on Saturday. Much of that is rich farmland that usually grows wheat and vegetables.The province had also said that 150 homes could be flooded.""Yes, we've made a lot of progress over the last few days,"" said Steve Ashton, Manitoba's minister of infrastructure. ""(But) there's no all-fair flood siren going out.""Across Manitoba, 3,600 people have been forced to leave their homes due to the threat of flooding.All three homes in the intentionally flooded area east of Portage la Prairie have dikes that are holding back the water, said Steve Topping, an official at the government's water stewardship branch.The Assiniboine was near its peak on Monday at Brandon, the province's second-biggest city, where at least 1,300 people have left their homes.About 1,500 Canadian soldiers are helping local volunteers with sandbag operations.The province is diverting some water off the Assiniboine into Lake Manitoba, which looks to reach its highest level in 50 years by mid-June, provincial officials said.Ranchers there have had to move thousands of cattle because of flooded pastures.Flooding has already ebbed along the Red River, which runs north into Manitoba from the northern U.S. Plains.

"March 16, 2011: ""Windhoek ¡ª Thousands of people and livestock in the Caprivi Strip have had to be evacuated during as annual floodwaters rise in the Zambezi. However, loss of life has been kept to a minimum as informal warning systems prove to be effective.The flooding has affected villages and schools in the rural area. In recent weeks close to 4,000 people have been evacuated to 17 camps situated on higher ground in the Caprivi Region, Namibia's poorest area.The narrow strip of land, barely 30 kilometres wide borders Angola, Botswana, Zambia and Zimbabwe. It is traversed by the Zambezi and some of its major tributaries, the Kwando, the Chobe and the Linyanti.""he Zambezi is stable at around 6.37 metres and the water levels don't seem to be worsening for the moment,"" said chief hydrologist Guido van Langenhove of the Department of Water Affairs in Windhoek.However, in the latest flood bulletin, the hydrologist also noted there were ""very good rains in the very upper parts of the catchment in Angola"" which could mean even higher water levels in several weeks' time.Large areas in the Linyanti and Kabbe constituencies, near the Botswana and Zambian borders are already under water. ""The rainy season is supposed to last several more weeks, so it is possible that it rains again upstream in Zambia. In that case we can expect more flooding, but at least we will know it weeks in advance,"" said Van Langenhove.Local authorities have devised an early warning system that is one of the best functioning in the region. The system relies on informal communication of water levels from country to country by email or telephone.""We have definitely seen an improvement in the speed with which disaster management teams respond. Earlier we would have to mobilise helicopters to airlift people and there was no provision for camps,"" says Van Langenhove.""Because we now can give a warning three weeks before the flood arrives, evacuation points are being prepared on time. Authorities know which people and how many people need to be evacuated, there are enough tents and there is sufficient supply of clean drinking water. Schools get sufficient warning to alert their learners.""Japhet Iitenge Director of Disaster Risk Management in the Office of the Prime Minister, says, ""Together with the forecast of the meteorological office, the warning system that the hydrologists have put in place really enables us to prepare for the floods.""Our preparation started already at the end of last season, with drawing up and revising disaster plans. When we receive the warning that the floods are coming we start implementing them. With the system we are definitely better prepared than before and are able to move people to other villages and temporary camps where they still till the floods subside.""Raphael Mbala, chair of the Caprivi Regional Council, said that in recent days the water has again risen with several centimeters, but casualties so far seem minimal. ""I only know of one fisherman who drowned in one of the villages, otherwise there have been no fatalities.""As the councilor from Kabbe, the most affected constituency, he has overseen the evacuation of an important part of the Region. ""All the people and livestock have been evacuated to higher ground. Some villagers will relocate permanently, but most will return to their homes.""They could face a long wait. ""Sometimes the people can only return to turn homesteads in August,"" said MbalaHe says that the evacuation procedures have been helped by the early warning systems. ""This year for instance we have been successful in moving schools. With the actual school premises being flooded, we have relocated learners and classes continue on higher ground. In my constituency we have relocated four out of six school so far.""For Kabbe alone this means that 720 learners had to be relocatedThe residents of the area are becoming more and more accustomed to the annual floods that disrupt normal life for months.""When I was growing up, floods like this were something that occurred every ten or twenty years,"" says Mbala who is now 63. ""Situations like the one we have now happened in 1961, 1968, 1978 and then in 2003. Since 2003, however, we have had large floods every single year.""Mbala blames the increasing frequency of heavy floods on climatic changes affecting the basin. ""The situation is too much for the government to cope with. We get help from U.N. agencies and the Red Cross, but we still need more blankets, mosquito nets and tents. There is water enough, since we are now basically surrounded by it, but we need more purification tablets to make it safe for consumption."" "

"March 11, 2011: ""A magnitude 8.9 earthquake rocked Japan today, causing a 23-foot tsunami that's plowing a destructive path that has killed at least 300 people, washed away cars and bridges, and knocked out nuclear power plants. The death toll is expected to rise. It's still dark in Japan, but come daylight, people expect to find more bodies. Japanese officials have already found 200 to 300 bodies in a northeastern coastal city of Sendai. Another 110 people have been confirmed dead and at least 544 people are injured, the Associated Press reported. There are also reports of a missing train full of dozens of commuters in the earthquake region and a boat with hundreds on board being swept out to sea in the tsunami. The earthquake is now officially the fifth largest earthquake in recorded history, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. The quake hit at 2:46 p.m. local time in Japan, washing away buildings in seconds. The earthquake lasted for five minutes. To put that in perspective, the devastating earthquake in Northridge, Calif., in 1994 lasted just six seconds. At least 80 aftershocks above magnitude 5.0 -- and some as large as 7.4 -- have struck Japan reversing the path of rivers, washing away boats and cars and leaving buildings shaking like jelly. The earthquake hit the northern part of Japan hardest, but could be felt as far inland as Tokyo. ""It started and it lasted a good five minutes, lots of shaking and very scary. I'm on the 11th floor, just down the street from the Tokyo tower,"" said Randy Castle, an American working in Japan. The Tokyo tower, a famed landmark in Japan, is now bent.""It was a lot of swaying, you could hear the building creaking in it ... you could see the shades shaking back and forth,"" Castle said. ""The people that I work with here in Tokyo, it was normal for them, but shortly after that it started to get scary the longer it went."" It's the strongest earthquake the world has seen since the 9.1 magnitude Indian Ocean quake in 2004 which triggered a massive tsunami.

"February 15, 2011: ""(IRIN) - From a distance, the fields of maize that cover almost every hillside in Lesotho¡¯s Thaba-Tseka District look green and lush. On closer inspection, the plants have a sickly yellowish hue and the heads of corn that should be ripening in time for the April harvest are nowhere to be seen. For most of the farmers in this remote, mountainous district, and in many other parts of Lesotho, there will be no harvest this season. Heavy rains which started in December and are expected to continue through much of February have washed away top soil and nutrients and left fields waterlogged and weed infested. The UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) estimates that in some of the worst hit districts up to 60 percent of crops have been destroyed while nationally at least 4,700 livestock, mainly sheep and goats, have died. Lesotho¡¯s mountainous topography and erratic weather mean it already produces only enough grain to meet about 30 percen""f its needs. The country had increased its production of maize - the main cereal crop - and sorghum during 2010, but the heavy rains are likely to reverse those gains. ¡°It¡¯s going to affect food security in the worst way because Lesotho doesn¡¯t produce enough food as it is,¡± Matsiliso Mmojaki, head of the national Disaster Management Authority (DMA), told IRIN. Out of a population of just over two million, Mmojaki estimated 250,000 will need food assistance in the coming months. Not a disaster? In the village of Phaila, in Thaba-Tseka District, Tsepo Phaila, 31, watched one afternoon in early January as a river of water swept down a hillside, tearing up the trees he and his family had planted for firewood, and flooding their maize field. By the time the water receded, only a few broken stalks poked up from the mud. It's going to affect food security in the worst way because Lesotho doesn't produce enough food as it is ""an't plant there any more because the topsoil has washed away,"" Phaila said. The family has one other smaller field where maize plants are still standing but are too rain-damaged to produce a harvest. ""There's nothing we can do right now,"" said Phaila, explaining that the maize and the firewood provided the only source of income to support himself and nine other family members. Many other households in the village and across northern Lesotho are facing a similar predicament, but the government has yet to declare the situation a disaster. ""Should we say because the government hasn't declared it a disaster, it's not a disaster?"" asked Teboho Chalane, the Ministry of Agriculture's extension officer for Thaba-Tseka District. ""A lot of people have been affected; there will be no maize for them, so we need to do something to make sure they get something to eat."" He added that if seeds could be distributed quickly, there was still time for affected households to grow vegetables before the start of winter. In the longer term, said Chalane, communities needed to become less reliant on maize and start keeping livestock such as poultry and pigs that could be bred and sold. As for the fields of stunted maize plants, his advice to farmers was: ""Take a scythe and cut them all down."" Like many parts of Southern Africa, Lesotho had been warned to expect a heavier than usual rainy season due to the La Ni?a phenomenon, but Mmojaki of the DMA said ""the intensity [of the rains] was just beyond our imagination; it has never really happened here.""

"January 28, 2011: JOHANNESBURG, South Africa ¡ª South Africa is reeling from unusually heavy rainfall that has caused flooding in many parts of the country, wiping out crops in what is the continent¡¯s main breadbasket.More than 120 people have been killed in the thunderstorms and flooding since mid-December, and some 20,000 people are in need of assistance. The South African government has declared disaster areas in eight of its nine provinces.And it¡¯s not over yet. Above-average rainfall is forecast for South Africa and neighboring countries for the next few months.Much of southern Africa is now on flood alert, including Mozambique, where at least 13 people have died from floods and thousands have fled their homes for higher ground. Namibia, Botswana, Zimbabwe and Zambia are also o""ert for flooding.While this is the annual rainy season in southern Africa, the heavier than usual rainfall has been blamed on La Nina, the weather pattern behind the severe flooding in other southern hemisphere countries including Australia, Brazil and the Philippines.In South Africa, the government has put the flood damage at $211 million, but this is an early estimate and expected to rise. At least 13,000 homes have been damaged by the floods across the country, including thousands of shacks washed away, according to the National Disaster Management Center. Squatter communities known as ¡°informal settlements¡± have been most affected as they are often built near rivers and in other low-lying areas.The South African government, criticized for being poorly prepared to deal with the heavy rains, announced Thursday that it had stepped up its humanitarian efforts, including increased coordination with local authorities, to help people affected by the floods and to ""nimize loss of lives"" in further flooding.Health authorities are on alert for outbreaks of cholera and other waterborne diseases in South Africa and throughout the region. There are also concerns that the torrential rains will trigger an outbreak of Rift Valley Fever, a livestock disease that last year killed 26 people and 8,500 animals in South Africa.Floods have so far cost South African farmers $284 million, including damage to farm infrastructure and lost crops, said the farmers group Agri SA, but a full assessment can only be done once the water recedes. The crops most affected by the flooding are corn, sunflowers and grapes grown to make raisins.Agriculture Minister Tina Joemat-Pettersson this week promised government assistance to farmers in the form of replacing infrastructure, seeds and fertilizer, but said there would be no financial compensation.She warned that the floods would result in rising food prices because of supplies being affected.Earlier this month, heavy rains delayed and derailed trains, disrupting exports of coal and corn, said South African logistics firm Transnet.Joe Gondo, president of the National African Farmers¡¯ Union of South Africa, said that the system of dams on South Africa¡¯s swollen rivers needs to be improved in the longterm. But for now, all farmers can do is brace for difficult months ahead, he said.¡°For now, when the rain comes, this is a God-made thing. You can¡¯t stop the rain,¡± Gondo said.The South African Weather Service on Wednesday issued warnings of heavy rains expected for the next few days in Gauteng, Limpopo, Mpumalanga and North West provinces. The country¡¯s biggest dam, the Gariep, is 112 percent full and rising, and the Vaal Dam is at 100 percent capacity.Social Development Minister Bathabile Dlamini has appealed to the public to help with donations, saying that many provinces are running out of money to help those affected by the floods.¡°Without sounding alarmist, I would like to highli""fact that we are in a race against time to respond to the humanitarian needs of those affected,¡± Dlamini said in a media briefing.Most of the deaths have occurred in the coastal KwaZulu-Natal province, with 88 people recorded killed in the storms and floods, according to a report by Dlamini¡¯s ministry. In the Eastern Cape province, widespread hail storms have damaged property, livestock and crops, and 21 people have died. Lightning strikes and tornados have also caused deaths and property damage.In nearby Mozambique, which has also been battered by torrential rains, the government has issued a ¡°red alert¡± for potential floods in the country¡¯s central and southern regions, putting disaster relief workers on standby.In 2000, Mozambique was devastated by widespread flooding that killed 800 people, destroyed infrastructure and caused massive losses to agricultural production.January 26, 2011: ""ing in South Africa has killed more than 100 people over the last month, saturating farms in the major food producer for the continent and leading the government to declare 33 municipalities disaster areas.The government at the weekend said the death toll from the flooding had more than doubled from its previous estimate to over 100 people, with most of the fatalities coming from the eastern KwaZulu-Natal province. ""Without sounding alarmist, I would like to highlight the fact that we are in a race against time to respond to the humanitarian needs of those affected,"" Social Development Minister Bathabile Dlamini said in a Web posting on Monday.Preliminary assessments show about 424,150 hectares of land have been affected but there has not been an estimate on the financi...

Vhembe was among the municipalities declared disaster areas by Co-operative Governance and Traditional Affairs Minister Sicelo Shiceka. Limpopo local government and housing spokeswoman Tseng Diale said the village had been cut off during flooding late last week. Locals had been unable to leave the area. Emergency services were able to get to the area by land to deliver supplies. Last week four people drowned and two were injured during the floods in the province. All of the province's five districts had been affected with more than 1500 dwellings damaged. The Vhembe district was the most affected with 632 damaged houses.

"January 17, 2010: (Reuters) - Dozens of flood survivors desperate for news of missing relatives lined up outside a morgue in the Brazilian town of Teresopolis on Saturday as criticism grew of authorities' response to one of the country's worst natural disasters.Nearly four days after rains sparked floods and massive landslides, officials in this scenic mountain town are still struggling to cope with the scale of the catastrophe that has killed at least 564 people in the region north of Rio de Janeiro.Cemeteries in Teresopolis have been overwhelmed by the number of bodies and Brazilian media reported that residents in isolated areas have been forced to bury victims themselves.Mortuary officials in Teresopolis, where the official death toll is 238, are using two refrigerated fish trucks to hold dozens of bodies that have still not been identified.Many residents fear their relatives are still buried under the surge of water, mud and rocks that tore a path of destruction through some villages on the outskirts of the town, suggesting the death toll could rise sharply. Authorities have not given estimates on the number of missing people.Wemerly Moraes, 37, was waiting with his wife outside the morgue on Saturday morning to identify a body that could be the missing two-year-old son of his sister, whose body has already been buried.""This happened on Wednesday morning. When I went there on Thursday, there was still no-one working to find victims,"" the 37-year-old builder said. ""Maybe then he was still alive.""Up to half the victims of the disaster are feared to be children, charity Save the Children said.Gardener Odair da Silva told Globo television that he had to dig out the bodies of his father and stepmother from the wreckage of their home near Nova Friburgo town, where at least 247 people died. He left their corpses on the side of a road ""I asked firefighters for help but they aren't giving much priority to helping people,"" he said.The extent of the damage has posed a challenge for Brazil's new President Dilma Rousseff and exposed major flaws in emergency planning and disaster prevention in a country that aspires to attain developed-nation status in coming years.Rousseff visited the region on Thursday and pledged a swift relief effort that has yet to pan out in some of the hardest-hit areas, though anger has so far been mostly directed at state and local authorities. The federal government has earmarked 780 million reais in emergency aid and donations were starting to pour in from around the country.The torrent of earth and water swept like a tsunami through mostly poor communities, smashing houses and killing whole families as they slept. Some corpses in Teresopolis were found several kilometres away from their houses.Emergency teams are still struggling to reach some areas and have had to dig through the rubble with their hands because vehicles and heavy equipment could not get through. Steady rainfall is further hampering rescuers.Jorge Alfonso, a 42-year-old cook, said he lost 14 relatives when a mudslide virtually wiped out the village of Campo Grande, including his mother, two sisters, a brother and two adult sons. So far, only six of the bodies have been found.""I'm without words,"" said Alfonso, who has been moving back and forth between the cemetery to bury his relatives and the mortuary to identify them ever since the disaster struck.

At least 146 people have been killed in the town, 100 kilometres (62 miles) from Rio.Other officials said the disaster was the worst ever to befall the Serrana, a soaring, lush area that used to be a getaway for 19th-century Brazilian nobility and which is now a tourist spot, especially for Rio residents during the current southern hemisphere summer.In Nova Friburgo, 140 kilometers north of Rio, the number of victims rose to 155, while 34 were killed in Petropolis, according to GloboNews.At least three firemen were killed when they were engulfed in tons of mud as they tried to rescue victims.The death toll could rise in the coming hours, a spokesman for the Teresopolis municipality said. ""There are villages in the interior which we haven't yet reached,"" he said.Officials in Teresopolis said 2,200 people have either lost or had to abandon their homes.The full extent of the devastation remained unknown because communication and access to the stricken zone was complicated by the destruction of roads and bridges, while telephone service was cut in some areas.Authorities say they are particularly concerned over the fate of residents in the Campo Grande area of Teresopolis, where Civil Defence teams estimate 2,000 houses have been destroyed and 150 people buried, according to the G1 de Globo website. Rescue teams were expected to arrive later Thursday.The calamity was the first natural disaster facing Brazil's new president, Dilma Rousseff, who took power less than two weeks ago. She was scheduled to fly over the disaster zone in a helicopter later.At least as much rainwater as the region usually sees in two or three weeks hit the Serrana before dawn on Wednesday, as residents were sleeping in their homes.The downpour triggered mudslides and caused rivers to burst their banks, carrying away cars, homes and people.Meteorologists blamed the extraordinary precipitation on a cold front that intensified the already heavy wet season southeastern Brazil experiences every summer.That cold front moved through Sao Paulo early in the week before moving on to Rio de Janeiro state.More rain was forecast in the coming days.Rousseff's government has released 467 million dollars in emergency aid to help the rain-hit region.The health ministry announced it was also sending seven tonnes of medicine, including antibiotics, blood pressure remedies, masks and syringes -- enough to last 45,000 people for a month.The deadly downpour happened one year after mudslides killed more than 50 people in Angra dos Reis, another tourist area.At least 473 people were killed in Brazil last year as a result of heavy rains, according to the Estado de Sao Paulo newspaper.""January 9, 2011: ""RIO DE JANEIRO -- Brazilian authorities say the number of people left homeless by flooding has risen to about 100,000 in four southeastern states.

Others lost their autumn crops, household belongings, tools and seeds for the next planting season.In addition to the infrastructure damage to roads, bridges and canals, 2,000 hectares of paddy fields of the 3000 in the district of Vu Quang were lost, putting people at risk of starvation before the next harvest in May 2011. The most affected farmers are receiving short-term food assistance from the Government and humanitarian organizations such as Vietnam Red Cross, but the food gap is significantly bigger, revealed Oxfam, an organization committed to poverty and injustice.¡°The primary needs at this point are food security over the next three to five months, as well as livelihoods¡±, Oxfam's emergency response manager, Viet Vu Xuan explained. ""will take supplementary efforts for the next crop season, particularly seeds and fertilizers. Of the region's three crop seasons, the winter spring season which goes from November to April, was the most important, accounting for about 70% of total annual production.Rice, maize, sweet potatoes, beans and peanut crops are at risk unless more aid is forthcoming. According to Oxfam, the recovery of income and food sources may take three to six months until the harvest of the winter-spring season. However, for many families over five years may be needed to recover their losses.""

"November 5, 2010: ""LEOGANE, Haiti (AP) -- Hurricane Tomas flooded the earthquake-shattered remains of a Haitian town on Friday, forcing families who had already lost their homes in one disaster to flee another. In the country's capital, quake refugees resisted calls to abandon flimsy tarp and tent camps.Driving winds and storm surge battered Leogane, a seaside town west of Port-au-Prince that was near the epicenter of the Jan. 12 earthquake and was 90 percent destroyed. Dozens of families in one earthquake-refuge camp carried their belongings through thigh-high water to a taxi post on high ground, waiting out the rest of the storm under blankets and a sign that read ""Welcome to Leogane.""""We got flooded out and we're just waiting for the storm to pass. There's nothing we can do,"" said Johnny Joseph, a 20-year-old resident.The growing hurricane with 85 mph (140 kph) winds, was battering the western tip of Haiti's southern peninsula and the cities of Jeremie and Les Cayes.At least three people died trying to cross swollen rivers, Haiti civil protection officials said. The hurricane had earlier killed at least 14 people in the eastern Caribbean.The center of the storm was about 140 miles (230 kilometers) northwest of Port-au-Prince, draping charcoal clouds over the city. Steady rain turned the streets of the capital into flowing canals that carried garbage through the city. Farther north in Gonaives, a coastal city twice inundated by recent tropical storms, police evacuated more than 200 inmates from one prison to another.Aid workers are concerned the storm will worsen Haiti's cholera epidemic, which has killed more than 440 people and hospitalized more than 6,700 others.In Leogane, an earthquake camp suddenly became an island as floodwater surged around it, stranding hundreds of people in their tents.Closer to the shore, water poured into the Leogane home of Abdul Khafid, swirling around the furniture. His family grabbed its most important items - birth certificates, a radio and a computer - and headed to their mosque to spend the night.Haiti's civil protection department had urged people living in camps for the 1.3 million Haitians made homeless by the Jan. 12 earthquake to go to the homes of friends and family.But many ignored the advice, fearing their few possessions might be stolen or they might even be denied permission to return when the storm is over.Most of Haiti's post-quake homeless live under donated plastic tarps on open fields. Much is private land, where they have been constantly fighting eviction. A September report from U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said 29 percent of 1,268 camps studied had been closed forcibly, meaning the often violent relocation of tens of thousands of people.U.S. Marines were standing by on the USS Iwo Jima off the coast of Haiti, preparing to help take relief supplies if needed.Late Thursday, Tomas passed to the east of Jamaica, where schools remained closed and public transportation was stalled on Friday as the island struggled with widespread flooding from a previous storm.Patrice Edmond, a maid who caught a ride into Kingston, said buses were not operating.""I barely got a drive to come over, but I'm a determined person,"" she said.Seventy-five miles (120 kilometers) northwest of the storm's eye at the U.S. Navy base at Guantanamo Bay in southeastern Cuba, the military suspended flights, canceled school and closed the harbor to recreational craft."

Some bridges collapsed in the rushing water, complicating relief efforts.The shantytowns are built on unstable banks of gullies where thousands live illegally due to a lack of affordable housing. Authorities were keeping an eye on the murky brown waters that overflowed from the gullies, saying they could still pose a threat to residents.One slide toppled a concrete shack and killed a 14-year-old boy, known to his neighbors as Buju, who was found in a pool of muddy water.

""It was pain in addition to the pain of losing the crop.""Flood waters that rushed through his home in rural Jigawa state now cover about 34 square miles (55 square kilometers) of farmland there. As the bright sun begins to slowly dry the fields, all the farmers have are ruined stalks and dying plants -- the latest strain on food in a region where other nearby countries face serious shortages.The floods have come at the worst possible time -- just before harvest -- when it is too late for farmers to replant their fields of millet, sorghum and cowpea, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations.In northern Nigeria, unusually heavy seasonal rains sent water surging through overflowing rivers. A dam failed in the northern state of Sokoto, flooding out rural pasturelands there and killing about 40 people, according to local media reports.In Jigawa, local officials blame the inundation on officials opening two dams at reservoirs in neighboring Kano state. Typically, the water released yearly from the dams flows into farm fields across the region known as the Sahel, a band of semi-arid land stretching across Africa south of the Sahara. The waters irrigated the crops of Jigawa, a state home to more than 4 million people.This time, a huge wave of water from the reservoirs raced through already saturated stream and creek beds, quickly topping over Jigawa state's simple earthen levees, said Umar Kyari, a spokesman for Gov. Sule Lamido.About 2 million people -- about half of the state's population -- have been displaced or affected by the flooding that began two weeks ago, he said.The village of Gudinchin -- home to a few hundred people once surrounded by fields of tomatoes, corn, rice and millet -- is now cut off from the rest of Jigawa, an island in the midst of murky, fast-moving water ripe with unprocessed sewage. Besides swimming, the only way across comes from two, low-riding wooden canoes donated by the government.There, the dirt-walled granary quickly became a pile of muddy debris when the waters rushed in one night. Villagers used its walls to build an earthen levee against the rushing water. The millet able to be eaten can now be lifted up in only two handfuls.Garba Gudinchin, 55, said he and others live in fear that their dam won't hold long enough to allow the sun to burn away the remaining water. But beyond that, nearly all the village's crops now sit in ruin.""I cannot tell you the figure because it is big,"" he said in the local Hausa language.Nigeria, Africa's most populous country, relies on the crop from its northern states to feed the mouths of those in its oil-rich and commerce-driven south.Kyari, the governor's spokesman, warned the loss of crops would drive up food prices in the country, where most earn less than $1 a day. Kyari also estimates state ranchers lost millions of dollars worth of cattle in the flooding.The nation's farmers also supply other West African nations with their crops, countries already facing droughts and food shortages.In neighboring Niger, international aid experts warn the country faces the worst hunger crisis in its history following a prolonged drought and poor growing season last year. One of the poorest countries in Africa, Niger now has more than 7 million people -- almost 50 percent of the population -- suffering from a lack of food, officials say.Gautam Chatterjee, head of mission in Nigeria for Medecins Sans Frontieres, also known as Doctors without Borders, said the flooding could affect the region for the next two to three months.""In the longer term, this means an increase in food insecurity and an increase in malnutrition, especially for children under 5,"" Chatterjee said.For now, villagers in Gudinchin who lost their homes, like Mohammed Auwal, live with their neighbors. Flood waters washed away his home and those of his immediate family. His crops, which once stood out against the gray dirt of the farm fields nearby, can no longer be seen.""It's all destroyed,"" Auwal said"" September 20, 2010: ""Abuja  The National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) has traced the cause of the devastating flooding that ravaged communities in Katsina, Sokoto and Kebbi States to the release of large volume of water from the Goronyo Dam in Sokoto State; and warns that so far, other rivers and streams on that routes may be affected, especially in communities in Niger and Kwara States that host the Kanji dam.The acting Director General of the agency, Dr. Charles Agbo further explained that rather than using helicopters to monitor the areas of the flood, the agency has triggered the UN-SPIDER for the imageries of the extent of the flooding in both Sokoto and Kebbi States.He added that UN-SPIDER, based in Vienna, is United Nations Platform for Space-based Information for Disaster Management and Emergency Response aimed at providing universal access to all types of space-based information and services relevant to disaster management by being a gateway to space information for disaster management support and serving as a bridge to connect the disaster management and space communities.In a press release, signed by Yushau A. Shuaib, Head of Press and Public Relations, NEMA, Agbo was quoted as speaking after reassessing the extent of damages in Kebbi State where 30 villages and towns were adversely affected by flood that uprooted corpses from their graves; contaminated water, destroyed large farmlands and killed animals.He urged states to harness the potentials of huge water as resources for agriculture and preservation for fu""ure usage. He also advised the states to be adequately prepared for heavy flooding to avoid another catastrophe. He recommended that the governments should build barriers along river banks and move people away from low-lying places by the rivers and adopt strategic measures to control the flood.According to the statement, apart from distributing relief material to Katsina, Sokoto over similar incidents, the agency has responded to the plights of thousands victims that are being accommodated in Internally Displaced Persons camps in Argungu and Augi local government councils in the states with four truckloads of relief materials including foods, beverages, disinfectants, detergent, beddings, clothing and medicationsGovernor Saidu Dakingari while commending the NEMA's intervention in the rescue operation blamed the incidents on lack of maintenance of the dams especially Goronyo, Bakolori and Lubu that have either overflown the edges or collapsed due to poor infrastructure that cannot withstand the floods."" September 13, 2010: "" Thousands, including women and children from several villages have been displaced by flood in Argungu, Kebbi State, even as thousands are trapped and cannot be reached. The flood was caused by a spillover from Goronyo dam in Sokoto state.LEADERSHIP SUNDAY investigations reveal that already, Matan Fada, Mala, Gobirawa, Tungar Barke da Tungar Dangwari areas have been submerged. Other local governments affected are Gada, Illela, Gwadabawa, Goronyo, Wurno, Binji, Tangaza, Kware, Wamakko, Bodinga, S/Birni and Sokoto North.The situation was further compounded by the collapse of Danbachaka dam, built 20 years ago.

""We would like to assist the affected people to our best but the budget puts limit to our wishes,"" the official said. Floods in south Sudan have forced more than 50,000 people from their homes, health officials said on Tuesday, warning that the situation could worsen.Flood waters began rising earlier this month due to torrential seasonal rains in Northern Bahr el-Ghazal state, leaving much of the state capital Aweil under water and affecting thousands in the surrounding countryside.""In the last one month, 57,135 people have been displaced by the floods,"" said Olivia Lomoro, the ministry's undersecretary for health.Southern health minister Luka Monoja warned that the rains, which last until October, could force out more people.""It is not yet the end, because the rains are going continue up until October, so the situation may get worse,"" he said.""A serious situation has developed in Aweil; more than three-quarters of the town is flooded and many houses are collapsed,"" said Monoja.""The people are now living on the road, as it is the only area of the town that is raised.""Aid agencies have been working to support those displaced, the health ministry has sent medical supplies and the south?s humanitarian ministry is sending tents for emergency shelter as well as 15,000 bags of grain, Monoja added "
"August 1, 2010: ""Mercy Corps will provide nearly five tons of essential medicines and medical supplies to forestall water-borne diseases and treat affected populations. This assistance, which will reach approximately 100,000 people, is funded by the USAID's Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance and private donors. Mercy Corps is coordinating with partner agencies Samaritan's Purse and Global Resources Services as well as with local representatives to identify and respond to the most urgent needs. ""Over the last decade, Mercy Corps has developed a relationship of trust and respect with the North Korean people,"" said Jim White, Mercy Corps Vice President of Program Operations. ""At this critical time, we want to reach out to families who are suffering huge losses as a result of flooding."" The UN estimates that in hard-hit North Pyongan province, flooding has heavily damaged or destroyed more than 7,100 homes, and 17,790 acres of farmland have been submerged or washed away. Heavy rains have washed out numerous bridges and railway lines, and created widespread power and telecommunications outages. The flooding has also jeopardized North Korea's already-fragile agricultural capacity, reportedly inundating or washing away valuable crop lands - sparking fears of widespread food shortages. Mercy Corps has worked with vulnerable North Korean families and communities since 1996, striving to help meet health and nutritional needs as well as collaborating on long-term agricultural and economic solutions. In 2008, Mercy Corps was the lead of five aid agencies that implemented a groundbreaking USAID-funded food program in Chagang and North Pyongan Provinces. The organization's co-founder, Ells Culver, reached out to the North Korean people after the country suffered years of drought, flooding and food shortages. That diplomacy has led to an extraordinary partnership that includes farmer exchanges between North Korea and the United States' Pacific Northwest. Mercy Corps has long been at the forefront of efforts to bring reconciliation and mutual understanding to the sometimes-contentious relationship between North Korea and the United States. Through the East Asia Advisory Committee and National Committee for North Korea, Mercy Corps is bringing together various stakeholders to discuss ideas for collaboration. North Korea is struggling with heavy rains and massive flooding that have washed out homes and ruined crops across the country. The worst flooding is in the north, on the Yalu River, which separates North Korea from China. Beijing has already offered help, and now the United States is, too....."" ""Robert King, the U.S. special envoy for North Korean human rights, told VOA's Korean service in an exclusive interview that Washington will send $750,000 in emergency aid to Pyongyang. He said the money will be given to three independent aid groups: Samaritan's Purse, Global Resource Services and Mercy Corps. ""We've received reports of the seriousness of the flooding in North Korea,"" King said. ""The North Korean government reached out to these three non-government organizations that we're working with and to another NGO and requested assistance.""King added the groups will use the money primarily for medical supplies and will fly the aid into Pyongyang beginning this week. The aid comes amid a flurry of diplomatic activity surrounding North Korea. Washington has imposed additional sanctions on Pyongyang in response to the deadly sinking of a South Korean war ship earlier this year. And former U.S. President Jimmy Carter recently traveled to North Korea to secure the release of an American jailed for illegally entering the country.King dismissed speculation that the assistance is a political tool to lure North Korea back to international talks on its nuclear program.""Our humanitarian assistance is provided solely on the basis of the need and our ability to provide the assistance and to monitor that it's being received by those in need,"" he said.  "

"September 9, 2010: ""Already stricken by a severe food crisis brought on by a prolonged drought, the people of Niger have now to contend with floods which have affected more than 200,000 people, the United Nations said on Friday.The floods, the result of heavy rainfall, have exacerbated the misery of people who had already lost their livelihoods to the drought. Many have been forced to seek shelter in community buildings, mostly schools, losing whatever social support mechanism they had, the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) reported.More than 7,000 homes have been completely destroyed and at least 2,000 damaged. Flood waters have inundated an estimated 5,300 hectares of farmland, according to Elisabeth Byrs, OCHA's spokesperson in Geneva.Humanitarian agencies are providing support to local committees set up to respond to the flood emergency, with more effort devoted to measures to mitigate the effects of the disaster. OCHA has continued to chair disaster coordination meetings both nationally and regionally, Ms. Byrs said.The floods, which began last month, have been blamed for several deaths and the loss of 100,000 cattle, according to OCHA. The drought caused crop failure and livestock deaths.An assessment carried out in April indicated that over 7 million people, or about 46 per cent of Niger's population, are suffering from moderate or severe food insecurity.9 august:Thousands of people are awaiting aid in Niger after record rains caused flooding that destroyed hundreds of homes and crops. The River Niger, which flows through nine west African countries, is at its highest level in almost 100 years.Exceptionally high precipitation has sent the river flowing at 1,990 cubic metres per second - its highest level since 1929, according to the Niger Basin Authority.In Niger's capital Niamey, more than 5,500 people have been affected by the rising waters since Thursday, regional governor Soumana Djibo said."" August 11, 2010: ""Thousands of homes have been flooded in and around Niamey Some five thousand people in Niger lost their homes and crops after the River Niger burst its banks at the weekend.The West African country is already suffering from severe food shortages caused by recent drought.Another 20,000 people are at risk of displacement in the event of further heavy rains, UN officials have warned.Heavy rainfall has also caused flooding across other parts of West and Central Africa and threatens to worsen the food crisis in the region, the UN said.Millions of people are without food in the region after droughts over the last year depleted stocks, the UN World Food Programme warned. ""Rain in the Sahel is much welcome but it needs to be properly distributed over time and over space which is the major issue now,"" the WFP's Naouar Labidi told Reuters news agency.The BBC's Idy Baraou in Niger's capital, Niamey, says many more houses in and around the city are in danger of collapsing and residents fear that more heavy rain is still to come.The UN said that 30,000 animals had died in the flooding and carcasses could be seen floating near water points, spreading further fears of outbreaks of waterborne diseases.Regional havocMeanwhile, on Monday the authorities in Ghana issued a flood warning for three northern regions because of rising water levels at two dams in neighbouring Burkina Faso. According to the UN's Irin news agency, 40 people have already died in flooding in Ghana in June and July.In Burkina Faso, the agency reported that 14 people had died last month in floods and many people were sleeping in schools and other public buildings.Northern Chad in the Sahara desert has recently recorded the heaviest rain in 50 years and hail stones the size of eggs destroyed crops in central Guinea in July, Irin said.The International Federation of the Red Cross says it is providing aid to flood victims in the Central African Republic and in Ivory Coast, where there have been mudslides.On Monday, at least 13 people died - most of them children - in the Sierra Leonean capital, Freetown, when a building collapsed during a mudslide, following torrential rain"

A snowy winter and wet spring and summer ""set the stage"" for the flooding, but the recent storms were the big problem, weather service meteorologist Jim Lee said.""The bulk of this has been caused by those recent extreme rainfalls, especially back-to-back-to-back,"" he said.Divers found the girl's body near the submerged cars in Mud Creek about 2:20 p.m., more than 10 hours after she disappeared. Authorities said fast-moving water hindered their search efforts earlier in the day.Polk County Deputy Keith Onley declined to identify the girl.The cars were swept off the road between Altoona and Mitchellville about 4 a.m. Rescuers found 10 of the 11 passengers clinging to trees and hanging onto logs. Four were taken to the hospital with non-life threatening injuries.Doug Phillips, a division chief with the Polk County Sheriff's Office, said the creek is usually only 3 feet deep and 10 feet wide but early Wednesday morning, ""it looked like a river.""In Ames, about 30 miles north of Des Moines, officials shut off the city's water supply at 2:30 p.m. Wednesday after a water main broke beneath the flooded Squaw Creek. The break drained a city water tower, dropping pressure in the distribution system and raising the possibility the system's water could become contaminated.Officials warned anyone who still had access to water to boil it before consuming it. They said repairs could take up to 24 hours.Several hundred Ames residents were evacuated from their homes after 3 to 5 inches of rain pushed Squaw Creek and Skunk River over their banks, Fire Chief Clint Petersen said. In some spots, water was up to car windshields.The floor at Hilton Coliseum, Iowa State's basketball arena, was covered with up to 5 feet of water, school spokesman John McCarroll said. It was too soon to know how much damage had been done, he said.Jack Trice football stadium was still dry, surrounded by sandbags football players had stacked as a precaution.But the parking lot between the two stadiums, where tailgaters party before games, was flooded.""I hope they get it cleared out by football season,"" student Sam Stonehocker said.In all, eight campus buildings had flood damage, McCarroll said.The Iowa Department of Transportation closed Interstate 35 just south of Ames and both lanes of U.S. Highway 30 in the area were closed.Elsewhere in Ames, Howe's Welding and Metal Fab had several feet of water inside it, even though the owners had been sandbagging all night. Piper Wall, whose husband owns the business, said it was difficult to assess the damage while the water remained, but it appeared worse than in 1993, when much of the area was underwater.""It will be when all this comes out and all the mud that remains and the machining tools and electric stuff that's not high enough,"" Wall said. ""In 1993, it was $150,000 and this year it's higher.""Downriver from Ames, the town of Colfax was nearly cut off by the rising Skunk River. Roads were covered by water, and people used boats to help neighbors move to higher ground.Colfax Mayor David Mast said he expected more than 200 homes would flood, and some were already inundated with about 4 feet of water. City officials had asked at least 300 residents on the west side of town to move to higher ground, Mast said.After Heather Kern was asked to leave at 12:30 a.m., she rushed to move possessions out of the home she shared with her husband, two children and three other relatives. When sirens sounds a few hours later, the family had to evacuate.Kern's basement was flooded, and water was inching into the first floor with waste-high water in the backyard.""I feel blessed that we have our lives,"" Kern said. ""We don't know where we're going to live or where we're going to stay, but we have our lives.""Colfax flooded in 1993, when the Skunk River reached a record of over 21.5 feet, more than 4 feet over flood stage.

"August 11, 2010: ""ZHOUQU, China (AP) ¡ª Heavy rains on Wednesday lashed a remote section of northwestern China where weekend flooding killed at least 702 people, as hopes of finding more survivors faded and crews worked to stave off outbreaks of disease.More than 1,000 people were still listed as missing in the disaster, with mud, stones and debris covering many houses.The National Meteorological Center warned there was a ""elatively large"" chance of more landslides in the coming days, as the rain was expected to grow heavier, with up to 3 ? inches forecast for Friday. The chances of finding more survivors were falling by the hour, but soldiers on Wednesday rescued a 50-year-old man who had been trapped in knee-deep mud on the second floor of a hotel, the state-run Xinhua News Agency reported.Troops and rescue teams joined by traumatized survivors turned to recovering bodies and seeing to the needs of the living. Clean drinking water was a primary concern, with most local sources destroyed or too polluted to use.Entire communities in Gansu province's Zhouqu district were swallowed up when the debris-choked Bailong River jumped its banks Sunday, releasing wave after wave of mud and rubble-strewn water. While torrential rains were the direct cause, tree cutting that left the dry hills exposed and the weakening of cliff faces by a massive 2008 earthquake were seen as contributing factors.Buildings were torn from their foundations, their lower floors blown out by the force of the debris-laden water. Three villages comprising hundreds of households were entirely buried and much of the county seat left submerged.""In some households, all the people have died,"" making the counting of the dead more difficult, Zhang Weixing, a Ministry of Civil Affairs official, told a news conference Wednesday.Crews using explosives and excavators rushed to drain an unstable lake on the Bailong upriver of Zhouqu, fearing more rain could cause a massive breach, bringing more misery to the town.""The danger of the barrier lake collapsing has been basically eliminated,"" Jiao Yong, deputy vice minister of the Ministry of Water Resources, told the news conference.Disinfectant crews in protective suits sprayed chemicals across the ground and over machinery, the smell of death heavy in the air. State media reported numerous cases of dysentery, while infected injuries, a lack of sanitation, clean drinking water and accumulating garbage increased the risk of typhoid, cholera and other diseases.But the deputy director of the Health Ministry's emergency office, Zhang Guoxin, said there have been no reports of an epidemic outbreak.Rescue crews have been largely reliant on hand tools, with heavy equipment either unable to traverse the difficult terrain or mired in mud up to several yards (meters) deep.But roads reopened Wednesday, allowing heavy earth-moving equipment and supplies to flow in.At least 45,000 people have evacuated their homes, and the Ministry of Civil Affairs reported the delivery of 30,000 tents to the area, with thousands more on the way. Zhouqu has a population of 134,000, but it wasn't clear how many needed emergency shelter.Shen Si, a member of the Tibetan ethnic group native to the area, watched forlornly as troops dug to reach the bodies of her relatives inside their buried home.""My mother and father in their 60s and my younger brother, all three of them, are buried here in our house still,"" she said.Throughout the area, bodies were seen wrapped in blankets and tied to sticks or placed on planks and left on the shattered streets for pickup.China's leadership has ordered teams to continue the search for survivors, and the ruling Communist Party's all-powerful Politburo Standing Committee met Tuesday to discuss rescue and relief work.""It is now a critical time ... we must give the highest prominence to the protection of people's lives and properties,"" it said in a statement.Flooding in China has killed about 1,800 people this year "" More heavy downpours are expected today through Friday across northeastern Jilin Province where more than 100 people have been killed due to flooding and consequent landslides.Analysts are divided over a possible decrease in grain production due to the flooding that may lead to price hikes and hamper government efforts to contain inflation.In Tonghua, imminent rain is likely to daunt workers who had been rushing to repair flood-damaged water pipelines, almost four days after more than 300,000 residents were left without tap water supplies, authorities said.It remained unclear when tap water would be restored, but authorities said 1.5 million bottles of water are available for emergency purposes, the Xinhua News Agency reported Tuesday.In Baishan, workers were racing against time before the arrival of heavy rains, to clear an accumulation of garbage, up to one-meter thick and covering an area of 15,000 square meters, which blocked the flow of water under a bridge and threatened a downstream dam, Xinhua reported.Wang Yanbo, a resident in Yanji, Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture in Jilin Province, told the Global Times that many buildings in the city have been damaged and some villages in Yanbian have become flooded. The supply of water and electricity in these villages has been cut off.The tap water system in the neighboring city of Longjing was destroyed, and people are relying on water supplies provided by the Yanji Public Security Bureau for fire control, Wang said.Jilin Province is the latest region to suffer from what has been described as the worst floods in more than a decade."

Hundreds of homes and businesses were swept away in hours. The floods that hit Pakistan in the summer of 2010 took 2,000 lives and affected 20 million people, of whom 7 million remain homeless.. At their peak, one-fifth of Pakistan was under water, more than 3 meters (10 feet) deep in some places. As the disaster slowly unfolded, a world that had just opened its wallets for Haiti's earthquake victims was called upon to respond again.

Information Minister Qamar Zaman said 722,000 homes have already been damaged and flooded roads are hampering relief efforts.The United Nations appealed for $460 million in aid today to assist at least six million people displaced by a wave of water that has descended on Pakistans economic heartland. Almost 700,000 hectares of standing crops are under water or destroyed by floodwaters, the Food and Agriculture Organization said. Pak-Arab Refinery Ltd. closed its Multan plant, which processes a third of the countrys crude oil.As many as 50 million people have been affected, John Holmes, the UNs emergency relief coordinator, said in New York.The number of people affected is much larger than the Pakistan earthquake of 2005, the tsunami, that struck the Indian Ocean basin in 2004 or the magnitude 7.0 earthquake that devastated Haiti in January, Holmes told journalists.Pakistan has never seen a disaster of this scale, Abdul Sattar Edhi, founder of the Edhi Foundation, the nations biggest rescue service, said by telephone from Peshawar, predicting at least 2,200 people may have died so far. We need to rebuild everything from scratch and the biggest challenge is rehabilitation.Southern Punjab province may face critical flooding between now and Aug. 14, Shafaqat Ahmed, the military commander for Multan said at a news conference today. A third flood peak may hit the area at the end of the month, he said.Cotton, rice, sugarcane and maize crops have been damaged and fruit orchards have been washed away by the monsoon rains, putting at risk the governments farm output growth target of 3.8 percent for the year that started July 1.Almost two weeks after much of the northwest was first inundated, southern Sindh province is being ravaged by water flowing down the Indus at up to 10 times the normal volume.Jacobabad, Sukkur and Larkana are among districts at risk. Low-lying areas of Hyderabad, Pakistan¡¯s sixth-largest city, may be inundated within 24 hours.¡°Our protective arrangements are all in place,¡± said Abdul Qadir Paleejo, executive engineer at the Kotri Barrage, a dam spanning the Indus 8 kilometers (5 miles) northwest of Hyderabad, a industrial city of 1.6 million people. ¡°We have strengthened our embankments and protective walls.¡±City officials began evacuating residents yesterday. The Kotri Barrage is the last dam along the swollen Indus as flood waters make their way to the sea, leaving behind a trail of unprecedented destruction.Officials say the flood¡¯s worst damage may be done at Hyderabad, the biggest population center directly on the 3,200- kilometer long Indus River. The city is home to textile mills and assembly plants for motorcycles and cars.¡°The barrage has the capacity to withstand a flow of 875,000 cubic feet per second, while the incoming ti""rrying a flow of 800,000, Paleejo said from his office at the dam. We are hoping it will pass without causing any damage.Pakistan said yesterday it will waive farm loans and help rebuild homes for victims of the floods as the government and aid agencies acknowledged they are unable to reach or assist many of the 14 million uprooted so far.The floods have knocked Pakistan back to the primordial era, the countrys ambassador to the UN, Abdullah Haroon, told journalists in New York. Six thousand villages have been wiped from the face of the earth.The government will announce a sweeping rehabilitation package once it completes a survey of lives lost and damage to property, the state-run Associated Press of Pakistan cited Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani as saying. A cross-party committee will coordinate relief activities, he said, after visiting camps in Muzaffargarh and Layyah.The World Bank said today it will assess needs and draft a reconstruction plan for affected regions.In Baluchistan province, our stockpiles are nearly exhausted,¡± and trucks hauling tents have been blocked for a week by flooded roads, the UN refugee agency, UNHCR, said in an e-mailed message.With more than 10,000 square kilometers (4,000 square miles) of Pakistan under water, the agency has delivered tents to people that have no dry land on which to pitch them.About 1,600 people are known to have died in Pakistan, and hundreds more in India and Afghanistan, from flooding caused by heavy monsoon rains. The death toll may jump as more inundated areas become accessible, Edhi said.Many people have died from the outbreak of diseases such as diarrhea and flood victims are in need of basic medicines, blankets and tents, Edhi said.At least 500,000 people made homeless in the northwest are see""ng shelter in public buildings and tent camps erected on high ground and along roads, the International Committee of the Red Cross said in a statement.The United States and Islamic militant groups, both pushing for influence in the world¡¯s sixth-most populous country, have sent teams to help homeless villagers in areas of the ethnic Pashtun northwest that for two years have been combat zones.Pak-Arab Refinery¡¯s plant at Multan, the nation¡¯s biggest refinery, has been shut as a precaution due to the floods and may start supplying fuel within a week, company spokesman Saad Husain said by phone from Karachi. Natural gas output has fallen after floods forced the closure of a well at the Qadirpur field.The U.S. yesterday pledged an additional $20 million in emergency aid, bringing its total promised to $55 million, State Department spokesman Philip J. Crowley told reporters.Australia said today its air force will send two C-17 Globemaster aircraft this week to deliver emergency supplies.""ust 3, 2010: ""TRescue teams in northern Pakistan are battling to reach tens of thousands of people cut off by monsoon flooding.While water is receding in some areas, many communities remain cut off by the region's worst flooding for 80 years.Unicef said 3m people had been affected and more than 1,400 had been killed. The government said some 27,000 people remained trapped and awaiting help.Renewed rain on Tuesday slowed the relief effort, with criticism rising of the pace of the government response.In the Swat Valley, where thousands are still rebuilding after a major military operation against the Taliban during 2009, the flooding has brought down bridges and left communities cut off.""The civil administration is totally zero in helping,"" one medical student, Abdullah, told the BBC.""There [are] no aid agencies here at the moment - I haven't seen anyone, because more than 25 bridges have been swept away. These are the metal bridges for carrying transport."" The Malakand region, which includes Swat, is among the worst-affected areas. Villages in Malakand have suffered heavy casualties, with roads and bridges washed away.Adnan Khan, a spokesman for the disaster management authority in the worst-affected province, Khyber-Pakhtoonkhwa, told Reuters news agency that logistics were now an immense challenge.""The entire infrastructure we built in the last 50 years has been destroyed,"" he said.The BBC's Lyse Doucet, in Islamabad, says the flooding would be a challenge in any country, but is a growing crisis for a country like Pakistan, already suffering economic woes and a Taliban insurgency.The return of monsoon rains has grounded helicopters and raised fears of renewed flooding.Forecasters said moderate to heavy rain would continue in the north-west and in southern provinces of Punjab and Sindh over the coming days.""Enhanced monsoon activity"" is also expected to continue during the first two weeks of August.Just as emergency services and the army said they were making some headway, the rains have come again. That has meant an immediate suspension of helicopter flights to stranded people.We've had about two hours of very heavy downpours. It has just eased up but more are expected in the coming hours - floodwaters could rise again and rivers will burst their banks again. Aid operations will have to be suspended for even longer.There are many areas the army admits that it has not reached at all. There are several valleys in the north-west of Pakistan where they do not know how many people have died or how much destruction there is. Time is now crucial for those people waiting for aid, who do not yet have food or clean water.The army had hoped that the initial rescue operation could be over in 10 days, but says rebuilding the damaged areas could take more than six months.Local official Mian Iftikhar Hussain said rescue teams were trying to reach 27,000 stranded people, including 1,500 tourists in the Swat Valley.But the biggest challenge for the emergency services is access, as so many areas had their transport and communication links destroyed and are now isolated.There are also concerns that yet more places could flood: a warning was issued to villages close to the Warsak Dam overnight, but no evacuation order was issued.The Pakistani military says it has committed 30,000 troops and dozens of helicopters to the relief effort, but winching individuals to safety is a slow process.Unconfirmed reports say that Islamist groups, some accused of having links to the Taliban, have been providing aid to many of the victims.Some survivors have complained that the government has responded slowly; several hundred people protested in the city of Peshawar, where homeless survivors have crammed into temporary shelters, and there have been angry scenes in Swat. In Nowshera district one flood victim, Faisal Islam, told the Associated Press: ""We need tents. Just look around. This is the only shirt I have. Everything else is buried.""Aid agencies say the risk of water-borne diseases spreading will remain high until the floodwaters fully recede.

The U.S. State Department issued a Travel Alert for China, warning U.S. citizens residing or traveling in China about the ongoing threat of flooding in many places in the country and advising U.S. citizens in the region to monitor local weather reports and use caution when travelling in flooded areas.Since June, more than 1,000 people have died or are missing as a result of flooding, landslides, and collapsed roads and bridges caused by torrential rains. Over three-quarters of the provinces in China have been affected, with Shaanxi, Sichuan and Henan Provinces most heavily impacted since mid-July. More than 25 major rivers are over flood stage. While less-developed, remote rural areas have been most affected, some U.S. citizen tourists have reported travel disruptions in other areas. Trains have been stopped or diverted, roads closed and flights delayed by severe storms.

Some of them contained trimethyl chloro silicane, a colorless, flammable liquid with a pungent smell.The Songhua River is the main source of drinking water for Jilin, the province's second-largest city.Emergency teams mobilized to recover the spilled fluid have so far recovered 400 containers. The teams tested the water and have determined it to be chemical-free, a government spokesman said.An explosion at a plant owned by the Jilin Petroleum and Chemical Company in November 2005 caused 100 tons of potentially lethal benzene to spill into the Songhua River. Following widespread panic, officials were forced to shut-down water supplies to nearly 4 million people, including the city of Harbin.The spillage caused substantial environmental damage in the Russian Far East, as a huge slick of chemicals was carried down the Amur.""

"July 14, 2010: ""NANCHANG - More than 10,000 people were forced to evacuate their homes in east China's Jiangxi Province Wednesday morning after heavy rainfalls triggered flash floods and overtopping of three reservoirs, flood control authorities said. The intense rainfall hit the province's northern areas early Wednesday, triggering flash floods and swollen reservoirs.Water has spilled over dikes at three reservoirs in Poyang County, the provincial flood control and drought relief headquarters said. Workers are rushing to dig and widen emergency waterways to lower the water levels in the swollen reservoirs. No casualties have been reported so far, according to the headquarters. Jiangxi's meteorological department Wednesday morning issued a red alert -- the highest level -- warning of the torrential rains. Heavy downpours in parts of central and eastern China have caused waterlines in major lakes and tributaries of the Yangtze River to rise to alarming levels. In east China's Anhui Province Wednesday, soldiers used explosives to blast part of a leaking dike on a swollen branch of the Yangtze River, preventing the flooding of riverbank villages. Apart from central and eastern provinces, heavy rainfall has also pounded parts of western China's Qinghai, Gansu, Sichuan, Chongqing and Yunnan regions, according to the National Meteorological Center (NMC). The NMC Wednesday morning reiterated its orange alert -- the second highest level warning -- for the storms, saying the rains would continue through to Thursday. China has a four-color coded rainstorm warning system. Red is the most serious level, followed by orange, yellow and blue. Parts of China experience heavy rains every summer, but this year's rains have been particularly devastating. Since the beginning of July, torrential rains and severe flooding has left 107 people dead, 59 missing and forced the evacuation of nearly one million people in ten Chinese provinces, mostly along the Yangtze River, the Ministry of Civil Affairs said Tuesday.""Chinese soldiers Wednesday blasted a dyke on a swollen tributary of the Yangtze in a bid to prevent flooding of riverbank villages.The soldiers had planned to demolish the Qingcao township dyke on the Dasha river Tuesday, but were delayed after torrential rains snapped the explosives' blasting wires.Soldiers, however, managed to repair the wires and blast the dyke Wednesday, when water levels subsided and weather improved, Zhang Jun, an army official in charge of the disaster relief work in Anhui province, said.Water levels at the dyke reduced after the blast, Xinhua reported.Days of torrential rains caused many leaks on dykes on the Dasha river and over 1,000 people living along it have been evacuated. Hundreds of armed police have been fighting the flood since July 7.The continuous downpour in Anhui province has disrupted the lives of over four million people, while more than 5,100 houses have collapsed and 17,700 others have been partially damaged in the heavy rains.The rains have also caused economic loss of more than 1.8 billion yuan ($265.5 million), according to the provincial disaster relief office."""

The small plane carrying Piedras Negras Mayor Jose Manuel Maldonado was flying over a rain-swollen reservoir about 25 miles east of Eagle Pass, Texas, when it went down, said Ricardo Castillo, a spokesman for the border state of Coahuila. State spokeswoman Irma Flores said there were no survivors. She said the dead included state Public Works Director Horacio Del Bosque, the pilot and three other people. The cause of the crash was still under investigation. The officials were surveying the condition of reservoirs along the U.S.-Mexico border, which have reached their highest levels in decades following days of drenching rain. That has forced officials to dump water into flooded rivers, with yet another storm on the way. The dramatic rise of the Rio Grande caused by Hurricane Alex and continuing rains forced the closure of at least one major border crossing between downtown Laredo, Texas, and Nuevo Laredo, Mexico. Officials evacuated the flood-threatened Vega Verde subdivision in Del Rio, Texas, some 110 miles upstream from Laredo, while high waters in the northern Mexican state of Coahuila have already damaged some 10,000 homes - many swamped in waist-deep water. ""That means there are 40,000 people who don't have any place to sleep,"" Gov. Humberto Moreira told the Televisa network on Wednesday. To the southeast, Mexican officials evacuated nearly 18,000 people from houses in Ciudad Anahuac for fear that water would overflow the Venustiano Carranza dam and threaten lives. Mexico's National Water Commission said the dam currently had the largest emergency water release in the country. Ciudad Anahuac Mayor Santos Garza Garcia said at least 1,500 homes already had been flooded in the town of Rodriguez, across the Salado River from his city. Water behind the binational Amistad Dam on the Rio Grande was at its highest level since 1974, according to the International Boundary and Water Commission, forcing officials to release water from it at the fastest rate in a quarter century. The Commission said the downstream Falcon dam would probably reach capacity within the next few days, suggesting future releases there will raise water levels along the river's lower reaches. Much of that downstream area is protected against flooding by levees, but Mexico's National Water Commission said it was worried about low-lying settlements, most built by poor people without official permission. ""One of country's most serious problems are irregular settlements on federal land and in flood-prone areas,"" it said. Authorities walked a painful, delicate line - forced to release reservoir waters they know will add to flooding in hopes of avoiding worse disasters. It was an unusual state of affairs in a semiarid region where Mexican and U.S. officials often squabble over rights to scarce water. Mayor Garza Garcia said 20 floodgates had been opened by late Tuesday at the Venustiano Carranza Dam, which was releasing 600 cubic meters per second into the Salado River, a tributary of the Rio Grande. ""It was preferable having controlled flooding than having the whole town disappear,"" Garza Garcia said. ""The situation is very critical."" Luis Lobo, who drove 16 people from Ciudad Anahuac to Nuevo Laredo, said hundreds of people from Ciudad Anahuac and nearby villages left by foot and were by the side of the road. ""They are out in the open. Men, women, and children with nothing to eat,"" Lobo said after arriving in Nuevo Laredo. Garza Garcia said soldiers planned to take food to those stranded. Sally Spener, public affairs officer for the binational Water Commission that operates the Amistad Dam, said the agency had tried to limit releases ""so that we would not exacerbate the flooding."" In Laredo, city spokeswoman Xochitl Mora said Bridge One was closed as a precaution ahead of the expected crest on Thursday. The water is expected to rise to 38.5 feet high enough to touch but not run over the bridge. Officials will remove the heavy steel shade canopies to ease the weight on Bridge One before the heaviest water pressure comes with the river crest, she said. About 11,000 pedestrians and 13,000 vehicles use the bridge daily. Officials were also evacuating 2,000 people near the swollen Rio Escondido, said Piedras Negras Mayor Jose Manuel Maldonado. And in Texas authorities evacuated the Vega Verde neighborhood of Del Rio was evacuated as more water was being released from the Amistad Lake, just upstream. One of three international bridges connecting Laredo, Texas and Nuevo Laredo, Mexico, was ordered closed as the Rio Grande rose dramatically. The water is expected to rise to 38.5 feet - high enough to touch but not run over the bridge. The other two Laredo bridges, including the heavily used World Trade Bridge, are expected to remain open. Hurricane Alex dumped heavy rains on the region last week, causing flooding that killed at least 12 people in the Mexican state of Nuevo Leon, where Ciudad Anahuac is located, and leaving some 130,000 without water service. The U.S. National Weather Service said a new storm was likely to make its way across the Gulf of Mexico and hit the region within a day or two. "" July 6, 2010: ""Hundreds of people have been evacuated and a border bridge closed in northern Mexico after days of rain caused flooding and water to swell behind a dam.Authorities in Coahuila state have closed the border bridge in Ciudad Acuna as a precautionary measure after water released from the Amistad dam raised the level of the Rio Grande. Ciudad Acuna lies across the border from Del Rio, Texas.Coahuila Gov. Humberto Moreira told local media Monday that about 10,000 people have suffered severe damage to their homes or possessions due to the flooding.The release of water from the Amistad dam raises the possibility that river levels could rise downstream in Piedras Negras, a city across the border from Eagle Pass, Texas"" . July 2, 2010: ""At least six people have died during heavy flooding in Mexico. The victims were killed in and around the northern city of Monterrey following storms caused by Hurricane Alex. One woman was crushed to death by a mudslide as large rocks from surrounding mountains crashed down onto her car. President Felipe Calderon said that 1,200 had been dispatched to help in the relief efforts.Hurricane Alex hit Mexico's Gulf Coast on Wednesday and moved inland. A year's worth of rain fell in three days in Monterrey, swelling the normally dry Santa Catarina river, which overflowed and destroyed homes and sections of roads. Tens of thousands of home are now without water or power and many residents have evacuated in search of emergency shelters."" July 1, 2010: ""Hurricane Alex has brought torrential rain as it weakened to a tropical storm over northeastern Mexico, flooding the city of Monterrey. At least two people were killed when a river burst its banks, inundating roads and washing away cars. Alex was a category two hurricane when it hit the Gulf coast on Wednesday night, but lost force as it moved inland. It was expected to dissipate over the Mexican highlands on Friday.The usually dry Santa Catarina river that runs through the centre of Monterrey turned into a raging torrent, flooding major highways and paralysing Mexico's third-biggest city. One man died after he was swept nearly 500 metres by the waters and trapped against a fence. The body of another drowned man was found in a creek.A 12-tonne statue of the revered Virgin of Guadalupe was knocked off its plinth on the river bank. Flood waters also hit the city zoo, sweeping animals including buffalo from their pens, the Reuters news agency reported. Alex was the first hurricane of the 2010 Atlantic season, and the first to appear in June since 1995. It caused severe flooding along Mexico's Gulf coast when it made landfall on Wednesday night.

We took opportune measures to evacuate people"" Thousands of people in coastal villages were moved to higher ground before the storm hit. Many towns were left without electricity, and phone lines were also down. Heavy seas caused by the storm also disrupted BP's oil spill clean-up in the Gulf of Mexico. Alex largely spared the US state of Texas, which had prepared for a possible direct hit. It brought heavy rain and caused at least two tornadoes, but there were no reports of injuries or major damage. However, there are still warnings of possible flash-flooding in some areas of the state.""July 1, 2010: ""Alex has drenched much of northern Mexico, paralysing the major city of Monterrey. At least two people were killed when the dry river roared to life and roads turned into rushing streams.Hurricane Alex ripped off roofs, caused severe flooding and forced thousands of people to flee coastal fishing villages as it hit land on Wednesday evening in the border state of Tamaulipas. Power and telephone service were down in several towns and cities. The storm weakened to a tropical storm as it moved west to Nuevo Leon state, but still caused major disruptions.One man died when he was swept away by a torrent of water along a six-lane highway, city Civil Protection director Pedro Trevino told Televisa Monterrey network. Another man was found drowned by side of a creek.Nuevo Leon state governor Rodrigo Medina de la Cruz told the network he had ordered all schools closed and appealed for people to stay home from all but essential jobs.

(CBC)Motorists who had their vehicles damaged during the storms have also begun to file claims with Manitoba Public Insurance.So far, more than 200 flood-related claims have been filed, said MPI spokesman Brian Smiley.About half the claims come from Winnipeg, where many vehicles sustained damage after going through underpasses filled with water and becoming partially submerged.Other vehicles were hit by debris, even trees, tossed about by strong winds. Claims from outside the city are vehicles damaged because they were parked in low-lying areas and were swamped.Flooding across city Calls to the city about flooded basements came from nearly every neighbourhood and are not concentrated in one area, officials said.

"May 30, 2010: The total clean-up cost for flood-stricken Otago will not be known for ""days if not weeks"", Civil Defence says. The extent of the damage across the region became apparent yesterday as surface flooding receded and the clean-up operation began. Waitaki Civil Defence spokesman Scott Ridley today said the area was slowly returning to normal. ""Some places that were looking like lakes are starting to look normal, even if they are sodden,"" he said. ""Our roads aren't in ideal condition any more but we'll get on to fixing them over the coming months."" Mr Ridley said about 50 rural roads remained closed, but some could reopen as contractors assessed and prioritised repairs. The about 3500 residents of Palmerston in Waitaki district remained on restricted water supplies to prevent contamination from polluted water, he said. The local reservoir has enough water for three days, provided residents conserved water, and the main supply would be restored once the Shag River level dropped. An New Zealand Army Unimog, police and civil defence staff delivered food and water over the weekend to areas isolated because of high water and land slips. Mr Ridley said while some residents remained cut off, they were ""all sorted"". It was too early to say how much the clean-up effort would cost, although it was likely to be in the millions, he said. ""There won't be an official figure from the council for days, if not weeks."" Mr Ridley said the flood was not as bad as expected but ""it's definitely one of the biggest we've had in the last few years"".

In Colesburg, KY the water level reached seven feet inside some homes. Some residents had to be rescued by boat. The Willett family's first floor was destroyed.""I thought we were maybe going to be able to come back to maybe an inch of water,"" Devie Willett said. ""Then I realized the closer - as we waded through - it was just going to be absolute terror in there.""Water-soaked furniture covered a section of the driveway. The downstairs floor must be replaced. Next door, eight inches of water reached the inside of the St. Clare Catholic Church, the second oldest church in the state.""The water come, up got everything muddy, got everything nasty,"" member Jerry Fowler said. ""The minute it went down, folks come in here to start cleaning.""Fowler says members of the congregation had removed church pews ahead of the flood. Now, with the water gone, a chipped concrete floor needs fresh paint, and a strange smell hangs in the air.""There's an odor that goes with these floods, and it takes a day or two to get that out of here,"" Fowler said.Down the street, Colesburg Baptist Church provides three meals a day for people like Sandra Ketron, who lost everything in the flooding.""Pictures, my wedding album - our 10th wedding anniversary is coming up this month.

They had to be rescued by boat earlier this week, and the water in some places was still 15-feet high Saturday.""This is all basically dry land, there should be no water there at all,"" Ketron said.Even though the water level reached seven feet inside the family's home, some things survived."" May 4, 2010: ""The Cumberland River finally began receding Tuesday, exposing mud-caked homes and submerged cars as officials searched door to door for more victims of a record-busting flash flood and weekend storm already blamed for nearly 30 deaths.No new fatalities were reported Tuesday and it was unclear whether anyone remained missing.The weekend deluge swept many motorists to their deaths even after forecasters and Nashville's mayor warned people not to drive. But staying put carried frightening consequences for others as the swollen Cumberland and its tributaries started pouring into thousands of homes.""I kept watching TV that was my source, and (Mayor) Karl Dean was saying stay put, don't drive,"" Nashville resident Cheri Newlin said. Police eventually told Newlin to evacuate on Monday, but by then, the water was so close that she had to flee by boat, leaving her three cats behind. She is now at a shelter and hasn't been able to get back to her house to check on her pets and assess damage.By Tuesday, the flash floods were blamed in the deaths of 17 people in Tennessee alone, including nine in Nashville. At least nine people died in vehicles in Tennessee. Others were found in their homes or yards, including an elderly couple discovered in their Nashville home. A 21-year-old Nashville resident died when he tried to wade the waters in front of his home but got swept away in the current.Sections of downtown and some of Music City's popular tourist attractions remained flooded Tuesday, including the Grand Ole Opry House and the Country Music Hall of Fame. Full damage estimates were unavailable, but the Opryland Hotel alone suffered more than $75 million in damage; it will be closed for three to six months.The storm dumped more than a foot of rain from Saturday to Sunday, sending floodwaters rising rapidly in the middle of the night.Residents in some of the hardest hit areas said they didn't know if they should flee or stick it out for fear that if they left their homes, they would be swept away by the muddy waters that turned streets into virtual rivers.""We had less than an hour to get out,"" said Amanda Fatherree. She left her home on Nashville's west side Sunday after her mother yelled that the Harpeth River, normally located a quarter-mile away, had crept up to her back porch.Nashville resident Judy Kestner had thought everything was going to be OK Saturday night when she went to bed. The water in her backyard had started receding, and there were no warnings of anything other than flash floods.But then the howlings of her Siberian husky awoke her at 3 a.m. Sunday. The dog had been trapped in about 3 feet of rising water.""It was up to her nose. She was barely getting air,"" said Kestner, 54.Robert Strunk, a retired computer designer who now works at the Opry House, wasn't told to leave until nearly midnight Saturday, and by then, it was too late to drive.

I couldn't carry clothes or anything,"" he said.Officials said they made the right call to advise people to stay inside, pointing to a higher number of deaths on the roads and outside than in homes.""At this point I'm not going to second-guess and say what should or could have been done differently,"" Mayor Dean said Tuesday.Hundreds of people had been rescued by boat and canoe from their flooded homes over the past few days. Those rescue operations wound down in Nashville on Tuesday, though it remained unclear how many - if any - people remained missing in Tennessee. Police spokeswoman Rachel Vance said rescuers were going door-to-door in flooded areas to search for more drowning victims but no new deaths were reported as of Tuesday evening.Authorities in south-central Kentucky were searching for a kayaker who was last seen Monday afternoon in the swollen Green River.More than 13.5 inches of rainfall were recorded in Nashville on Saturday and Sunday, according to the National Weather Service, more than double the previous two-day record.""You could tell as Saturday went along that this was a totally different event than normal,"" Dean said Tuesday. ""And of course it was very clear by Sunday that we were in a very serious situation.""Flash flood watches were issued on Friday, but National Weather Service meteorologist Larry Vannozzi said the service also took the rare step on Saturday to relay an emergency message warning people to stay off the roads.""We didn't just barely beat the record and we didn't beat it by a decent amount.

""I don't want to seem too dramatic here, but this is off-the-charts record stuff.""The water swelled most of the area's lakes, minor rivers, creeks, streams and drainage systems far beyond capacity. Much of that water then drained into the Cumberland, which snakes through Nashville.Bridges were washed out and thousands of homes were damaged. As the water began to recede late Monday, bodies were recovered from homes, a yard and a wooded area outside a Nashville supermarket.The Grand Ole Opry said it was moving its shows to alternate concert halls as water damaged parts of the arena. Floodwaters also edged into the Country Music Hall of Fame and LP Field, where the NFL's Tennessee Titans play. Ryman Auditorium, the longtime former home of the Grand Ole Opry, appeared to be OK.Businesses along Nashville's riverfront lost electricity Tuesday because of the flooding, and restaurants and bars clustered on a downtown street popular with tourists were closed. Laurie Parker, a spokeswoman for Nashville Electric Service, said a main circuit failed before dawn, knocking out power to downtown businesses in a 24-square-block area.

NITEROI: Rescuers raced against time yesterday amid fading hopes of finding survivors of a huge mudslide, with over 400 people now feared dead in some of the worst flooding to swamp Brazil in decades. Rescuers painstakingly pulled bodies from the thick mound of dirt and debris in the Niteroi shantytown of Morro do Bumba late on Friday and yesterday, bringing the death toll to 223. Another 200 people were feared to have been buried alive in the slum, itself precariously perched atop a garbage dump in this city just east of Rio de Janeiro. Some 60 hours after the heaviest rains in half a century unleashed floods and mudslides, rescue workers still were far from having finished the work of recovering bodies from beneath tonnes of rocks, rubble and earth. The floods tore through the metropolitan area¡¯s precarious hillside slums, or favelas. Niteroi was hardest hit, with at least 141 dead, according to the civil defence authorities. Across the bay, another 63 were found in Rio de Janeiro.

""From the point of view of mobility, the situation is better than yesterday,"" Rio de Janeiro Mayor Eduardo Paes told reporters at an early morning press conference. He urged residents to postpone meetings and avoid travelling in the city if possible. Schools remained shut for a second day. The government weather service predicted rain would continue until Saturday even after clouds broke briefly and rains eased this morning. A Fire Department spokesman said 39 people were killed in the city of Rio, famous for its beaches and Carnaval celebrations, while the remainder of the casualties took place in suburbs and in neighboring cities and town of the state of Rio de Janeiro.

Globo images showed buses struggling to drive through flooded streets in western parts of the city, though transit had largely returned to normal in the central business district. Paes called on those living in hillside slums at risk for mudslides - which were responsible for most of yesterday's deaths - to leave their homes as the rains continued. ""Their lives are at risk,"" Paes added. Brazil's popular football team Flamengo postponed a match with a rival team from Chile because of the rains.

In any case, the situation is under control,"" said Joao Ribeiro, director general of the National Disaster Management Institute.Emergency centres have been created where tents, mosquito nets, medicine and food would be available.Seasonal rains across southern Africa send water levels rising every year around this time, especially on the Zambezi which brings to Mozambique run-off from a long swathe of the continent as it runs toward the Indian Ocean.Mozambique is a frequent victim of flooding during its rainy season. Deadly floods in 2000 and 2007 forced tens of thousands from their homes.So far two flood deaths have been reported this year."".... Flooding in Mozambique and Angola has displaced thousands of families, prompting both governments to step up rescue operations and Mozambican authorities to issue a red alert for some areas.Torrential rain that has swept central Mozambique and southern Angola for weeks has caused some rivers to overflow into villages along their paths and many villagers have fled to higher ground.Mozambique's government issued a red alert late on Tuesday, one step down from declaring a disaster area, and said it would forcibly evacuate about 130,000 people in areas at risk in the centre of the country.A government spokesman said flooding was expected to continue along the Zambezi, Africa's fourth biggest river. The floodgates of the river's Cahora Bassa dam have been opened to ease the pressure on its walls and this was also expected to increase the floods.The poverty-stricken African country said it did not plan to ask for international aid for time being.""All the conditions have been created to evacuate and relocate 130,000 people living in areas of risk,"" government spokesman Alberto Nkutumula was quoted as saying by Portuguese news agency Lusa.""There is internal capacity to deal with the situation.""""March 8, 2010: At least two people have died in floods in the central Mozambican province of Sofala, reports Monday's issue of the independent daily ""O Pais"".The first victim lost his life last Thursday, when he was swept away by the waters of the swollen Buzi river. His body was then partially devoured by crocodiles.The second fatality occurred on Saturday in Dondo district, when a man made the mistake of trying to swim across the Pungue river. The current swept him to his death.By Sunday, the Pungue was 2.3 metres above flood alert level at the Mafambisse sugar plantation. In this area, the river had burst its banks and spilled across the main Beira-Zimbabwe highway between Mafambisse and Tica.As the waters rise, so traffic along this stretch of the road has been gradually shut down. By Sunday only large trucks and some four wheel drive vehicles were taking the risk of driving through the flooded stretch. Even then, they required a police escort, and the National Roads Administration (ANE) took the precaution of only opening the road in one direction at a time. Queues four kilometres long built up of vehicles waiting to cross the flooded stretch.Minibus taxis can no longer make the journey, and so passengers anxious to reach the other side are paying bicycle owners to carry them. The fare charged by these ""bicycle-taxis"" is 100 meticais (about 3.5 US dollars).Since Saturday, a goods train has been ferrying stranded light vehicles between Mafambisse and Tica. The railway runs parallel to the road, but is high enough to ensure that it is not affected by the flood waters.200 families at risk, who were temporarily sheltered at a primary school, have now been moved to a resettlement area at Tica, where over 100 plots of land are available for them to build new homes.According to Joao Ribeiro, general director of the country's relief agency, the National Disasters Management Institute (INGC), the situation is under control. However, there may still be people living on islands in the rivers and in other flood prone areas who are at serious risk. Ribeiro said that rescue teams have been formed to sweep through dangerous areas.Further north, the flood on the Zambezi is worsening, and at the weekend the Cahora Bassa dam was obliged to increase its discharges from 2,736 to 3,512 cubic metres of water per second. ....Based on UNICEF situation report, 210 families (1,050 people) have been affected by the initial inundation in Namathanda district; of these, 613 people have been evacuated to a temporary shelter located in Mufu village....March 1, 2010: ""Maputo ¡ª The district of Buzi, in the central Mozambican province of Sofala, has been cut off from the rest of the country by flooding on the Buzi river.The ferry across the river has been out of operation for the past week, and now the road connections to Buzi town are impassable, reports Monday's issue of the Maputo daily ""oticias"".There has also been flooding on the Metuchira river, in the neighbouring district of Nhamatanda. A bridge over the Metuchira has been damaged, and an electricity pylon has been knocked down, depriving the area of power.Sofala Provincial Governor Mauricio Vieira visited Buzi and Nhamatanda on Friday, and on Saturday met with the Provincial Emergency Commission. The meeting decided to allocate boats to Metuchira, particularly so that students who live in the Metuchira-Pita locality, but study in Nhamatanda town, can cross the river.Buzi administrator Sergio Moiane told ""Noticias"" that the situation in the district is worsening. On Friday, Vieira could travel overland to Buzi, but now the road from Beira to Buzi town, via Tica, is impassable.""Previously, we had the problem that the ferry was paralysed, and so people on the other bank, in the Estaquinha and Nova Sofala administrative posts, who account for 60 per cent of the district population, were isolated"", said Moiane. ""Now the Tica-Buzi road, which is our main access route, cannot be used"".It is still possible to take a boat from Buzi to Beira, but Moiane warned that the current bad weather is making even this difficult.Moiane said nobody is in danger of losing their lives, since people who used to live in flood prone areas were moved to resettlement sites on higher ground during the last major Buzi floods, two years ago. However many fields have been inundated, and the district administration is trying to ascertain the extent of damage to crops.Torrential rain has also been falling in the western province of Tete. The publicly-owned telecommunications company, TDM, blamed this weather for a cut in the fibre-optic cable between Moatiza and Do, near the Malawian border.This is imposing severe difficulties on the fixed and mobile phone networks, and on Internet access, in the province. TDM has pledged that its technical staff re on the ground working to repair the damage."

The INGC has responded by sending emergency teams into the Maputo suburbs, reporting back by radio every 15 minutes.Water invaded many homes, as their residents slept. Frantically, people tried to throw up barricades to divert the waters, or resorted to buckets to remove the water from their bedrooms.Thanks to Maputo's woefully inadequate drainage system, the main roads in the city have become rivers, and driving along them is hazardous. The drainage channels along the road leading to the airport have been unable to cope with such heavy rain, and have overflowed, so that the road is under several centimetres of water.25th September Avenue, the main thoroughfare running through the lowest part of the city, near the port, is completely flooded, and the shops lining the avenue have been inundated.Although, by midday, the intensity of the rain had lessened considerably, it was still falling, and the National Meteorology Institute (INAM) warned that there is a 50 per chance that it will continue raining through Wednesday night.So far it is not clear whether the same level of rain has fallen in rural parts of Maputo province. If so, then it would clearly threaten flooding on the Incomati, Umbeluzi and Maputo rivers.Indeed, the National Water Board warned on Tuesday that the Maputo river was approaching flood alert level, and advised people living nearby to remove pumps or other equipment from its banks, and not to try crossing the swollen river. January 22, 2010: The ongoing heavy-rains spell, believed to be another bout of El-Nino, seems to have this time spared the shores of Lake Balangida in Hanang District.The previous El-Nino spell in 1998 wrecked havoc on residential homes surrounding the lake in the Basotu and Katesh wards of Hanang, causing a mass exodus of people and leading to the total closure of Basotu secondary school.The local ward representative and community worker, Mama Rose Kamili stated: ""It is surprising this time there have been no floods along the lake, despite the fact that rains are falling in torrents here like in many other parts of the country.""In Katesh, the lake has remained calm as of late, with people busy harvesting soda ash, whose caked slates can be seen in a number of sacks dotting the shorelines.Mama Kamili, the area representative through the ruling CCM party, lives near the lake and a few months ago reported that people in the vicinity had started to vacate the areas near Lake Balangida after the Meteorological Department warned of imminent heavy rains that would affect the Nation.Located at the foot of Mount Hanang, Lake Balangida is a lifeline to more than 1000 fishermen and close to 5000 fish mongers and traders, with some coming from as far as Songea in Southern Tanzania and Mwanza around Lake Victoria shores"

Some help has arrived, but according to some local people, it is not enough, since many little towns like Lucre live entirely on agriculture, and now after the floods and mudslides, its residents they have lost everything they had. President Alan Garcia visited Cusco a few days ago, and he said that there were only 5,000 hectares of crops affected by the floods, and that these farmers would be benefitted by the agrarian insurance"" January 30, 2010: ""The number of people killed in heavy flooding over the past several days in southern Peru has risen to 20, local officials say.They say that at least five more people are missing and almost 40,000 others have been affected. On Friday, officials airlifted the last of nearly 4,000 tourists stranded near the Inca ruins of Machu Picchu. The tourists became trapped after floods and landslides destroyed road and rail links to the famous site. Peru's Cuzco region in the Andes is the worst-hit. Lucre - a village situated next to a river with the same name - was all but washed away earlier this week, the BBC's Dan Collyns reports from the region. ""Someone heard the noise and before we could even get out of our beds the water was flowing over them. Terrified, all seven of us rean in different directions trying to escape,"" she adds. Many local residents are now trying to salvage what they can from their destroyed houses. After the impressive airlift from Machu Picchu, bringing aid to hundreds of villages spread over a wide area will pose a far greater challenge, our correspondent says. Other regions such as Puno, Ayacucho and Huancavelica were also hit hard by the torrential rains.

We have been stuck here for six days, the last two days have seen three helicopters.""Cusco, Peru's main touristic destination, is currently drawing international attention due to the large number of stranded tourists; but other Peru regions such as Huancavelica, Apurimac and Puno are currently experiencing extremely heavy rainfalls too, that are causing severe large-scale damages. January 27, 2010: "" Huancavelica and Apurimac are Peru's regions with the highest extreme poverty rates, so the impact of these climatic events on their population and infrastructure is likely to be worse and to last longer. Only in Apurimac, more than 4,000 families have been affected by the rainfalls, and several sections of the Abancay-Cusco route have been literally swept away by the rivers surge, reported Apurimac's Regional President, David Salazar. In Huancavelica, some 30 mudslides have cut four spots of the Huancayo-Huancavelica railway, blocking the transit, and the situation in Yauyo, Acoria and Anta districts is getting critical. As for Puno, authorities of San Antonio de Putina province are also asking to be included in the state of emergency, since more than 6,000 hectares are flooded, as well as 10 public schools; reportedly, several bridges would also be about to collapse anytime. "

Authorities said an extensive flood-control system was working, but many of the basins designed to catch debris-laden runoff from fire-scarred mountains were full and evacuations remained necessary.

It said flash floods on and after 18 January left 780 homes totally destroyed, 1,076 submerged and the area suffered material losses of over US$25.3 million. The destroyed homes would cost the government $3.5 million in compensation, said the report produced by the Crisis Management Centre in north Sinai in cooperation with the Cabinet¡¯s Information and Decision Support Centre. The government has promised to give 25,000 Egyptian pounds ($$4,587) compensation to the owners of destroyed homes and 15,000 Egyptian pounds ($2,752) to those whose homes were partially damaged or submerged. The report also said the floods ruined 59km of roads, killed 1,838 animals and felled 27,820 (mostly olive) trees.

January 20, 2010: ""Heavy rain and flooding has forced hundreds of people from their homes in Khan Younis in the south of the Gaza Strip, according to the Gaza authorities. About 115 homes were damaged and the sewage system was reported to be overflowing. A witness in Gaza who works for a local NGO told IRIN that over 100 families had been made homeless, but warned the number might rise if the rain continued. Some experts told IRIN Gaza's poor infrastructure is unable to cope, and there was a risk that sewage mixed with floodwater could cause communicable and water-borne diseases. The Israeli government has so far not commented on allegations that Israel opened dams in Gaza valley, exacerbating flooding in the Strip. January 19, 2010: ""A second day of heavy rains and flooding in Egypt's Sinai Desert killed a woman and destroyed hundreds of homes, raising the toll for two days of storms to seven dead, the government said.

Six people, including a British tourist, were killed Monday in Egypt during the storms. One person died in Israel when her car was trapped in a flash flood. Egypt's state news agency said all 75 patients at the El-Arish general hospital in the Sinai had to be evacuated when the first floor was flooded. Some 300 families were also displaced. In the southern city of Aswan, floods and strong winds disrupted power in several neighbourhoods. ""At least six people were killed and hundreds displaced by rain-induced flooding on 18 January in the Sinai Peninsula, the Red Sea port of Hurghada and Aswan Governorate, southern Egypt, according to local officials and media reports.Rare torrential rains across the Middle East swept away homes, marooned resort towns and killed seven people Monday, including a British tourist, in what officials are calling the worst flooding in at least a decade."" The flooding along Egypt's Red Sea coast, the border with Israel and in the south left six people dead. It also damaged the roads leading to the resorts in the Sinai desert and brought down telephone and power lines. Israel temporarily closed its southern border crossings with Egypt and Jordan, while Jordanians were warned off the streets after nearly a dozen accidents in one area. Rains of this magnitude, which began Sunday night, are rare in this largely arid region and where heavy precipitation can result in sudden and deadly flash floods. A British tourist sailing down the Nile near the southern Egyptian city of Aswan died when his sail boat capsized in the heavy winds and sudden rain. The victim's wife and two companions, a Canadian and an Indian, survived, according Maj. Gen. al-Shafei Hassan, chief of criminal investigation in the southern city of Aswan. The heavy rains also washed away a dozen mud brick homes in southern Egypt and killed two women there. Scores of families in Aboul-Rish village in Aswan slept overnight outdoors after their homes were destroyed. In the famed monument city of Luxor, just to the north, the bad weather caused power failures in several neighborhoods and disrupted Nile cruises, sailboat and ferry schedules. In neighboring Israel, a woman drowned when her car was caught in a flash flood in the south, where stormy weather also blocked the main road to the Red Sea resort of Eilat. A bridge also collapsed near a cargo crossing between Egypt and Israel. Flooding wiped out large sections of a major road in Egypt's south Sinai and destroyed two dozen homes in Ras Sudr, according to Mohammed Fayez, the head of emergency services. The heavy rains also killed one woman, left 14 missing and damaged the roof of Sharm el-Sheik's old airport, he said. President Hosni Mubarak flew to Sharm el-Sheik and inspected the damage. Egypt's Middle East News agency reported that Mubarak ordered compensation be paid to the victims of the floods and he advised against the building of traditional mud brick homes. Witnesses in Taba, another tourist resort across the border from Israel, said the churning waters swept the sand on the beaches out to sea. In northern Sinai, officials at the provincial operation room dealing with the crisis said the flooding destroyed over 100 homes and many village huts. Mohammed al-Kiki, a local government official, said a flash flood overcame a dam and a man was killed near the border with Israel.

"December 27, 2009: ROME, Dec. 27 (Xinhua) -- Continued heavy rainfall worsened the situation in central Italy after a flood hit the area, leaving more than 500 people homeless, local media reported Saturday. In the last six days, Italy has been struck by heavy rains and a sharp fall in temperature. There have been no victims so far but infrastructure in many areas is completely cut off. The most damaged regions are Tuscany and Liguria, where road and railway connections have been interrupted by mudslides and water. Several flooded areas are still without gas and electricity. In the northern Emilia Romagna region, almost 550 mm of rain have fallen in the past several days, accounting for 40 percent of average annual precipitation. Infrastructure Minister Altero Matteoli on Saturday pledged to file an application for national state of emergency at the next cabinet meeting. Hundreds of firemen, civil defense workers and volunteers were trying to limit the impact of the flooding near the Tuscan towns of Lucca and Pisa, clearing debris and mud on the roads.

"January 7, 2010: Passenger train services on the Central Line will now be operated between Dodoma and Mwanza/Kigoma, the government announced yesterday.The decision follows extensive damage to the line, particularly in Morogoro Region, caused by floods.Infrastructure Development permanent secretary Omar Chambo said floods had rendered the Kilosa and Munisagala stations in Kilosa District inoperable.Mr Chambo made the announcement after inspecting a railway bridge, which was swept away in Kilosa District. The bridge carried the Central Line across River Mkondoa, which burst its banks following heavy rains lasting several days.He said the floods had destroyed three more bridges elsewhere, adding that the line had been damaged at 16 spots along the 293km stretch between Dar es Salaam and Kilosa.""The damage in all these places is severe, and major repairs are needed to normalise the situation,"" Mr Chambo said.About Sh4 billion is needed to repair the line, according to initial estimates, and the ministry has sent experts to assess the damage.Mr Chambo said the biggest task the experts and Tanzania Railways Limited (TRL) technicians were facing was restoring the natural course of River Mkondoa to allow the reconstruction of the destroyed bridge.This is the second time the Dar es Salaam-Dodoma section of the Central Line has been closed.The defunct Tanzania Railways Corporation (TRC) closed it for more than a year in 2006 before it was reopened in October 2007 by TRL, which took over TRC's operations three years ago.Passengers travelling between Dar es Salaam and the upcountry destinations of Mwanza and Kigoma had to make Dar es Salaam-Dodoma part of the journey by bus due to the closure.The TRL management has been grappling with liquidity problems and frequent strikes since taking over the running of the struggling railway firm.Mr Chambo also inspected the Morogoro-Kilosa road, which has been closed temporarily after floods rendered it impassable.The worst affected section is near Kimamba Township, where a bridge has been swept away, and several kilometres of the road flooded.Mr Chambo said waiting for the floodwaters to recede was the only option for both the government and people using the road.""We can't do anything at the moment because the entire area, including the road, is under water. We should wait for water levels to recede before repairs can begin.""Mr Chambo said a study had established the need for the road to be raised in the flood-prone area to make it passable at all times.He added, however, that the government was giving priority to repairs so that the road could be reopened as soon as possible.Meanwhile, over 400 people sleep in the open in Kilosa District due to lack of space in camps set up for people displaced by floods.A local government leader, Mr Zidadu Masanza, said 477 people were sleeping under trees because the camps were ""full to the brim""""We have no accommodation and as a result, men and a few children sleep in the open in biting cold,""he said.Most of those affected are from Mkondoa Village where dozens of houses have been destroyed by floodwaters that were several feet deep in some places.Mr Masanza said the number of tents provided so far was not enough, adding that displaced people were arriving at the camps in significant numbers daily.""Apart from tents, these people need other forms of relief such as food, bednets and medicines,"" he said.A total of 609 people, including 315 children, have been displaced by floodwaters that gushed through villages after River Mkondoa burst its banks last week.The relief coordinator at a camp in Kisiki Ward, Mr Mganga Msakuzi, said the floods had displaced 56 families in the area, adding that 70 people were sleeping in the open for lack of tents.Mr Msakuzi said criminals were taking advantage of the situation to steal from victims at night, and appealed for security in camps to be stepped upJanuary 5, 2010: ""The TMA said northern coastal regions like Dar es Salaam, Tanga as well as Zanzibar and Pemba islands would get normal to above normal rains, as will areas around Mount Kilimanjaro.The current Pacific build-up looks like a mild version of El Ni-o which has in the past devastated the globe, according to the United Nations weather agency.The TMA warning has come at a time when thousands of people in the country have been displaced by flash floods which have hit their districts.The most affected is Kilosa District in Morogoro Region where three people have died and more than 23,000 people have been displaced after their houses were either destroyed or surrounded by flood waters.The floods have also hit Kongwa District in Dodoma Region, parts of Ruvuma Region and Same District in Kilimanjaro Region.The Government, Red Cross Society and other organisations as well as individuals, including the MP for Kilosa, Mr Mustafa Mkulo, have been pouring in assistance to the victims, most of whom have been left without a roof over their heads.The Prime Minister's office had dispatched 42 tonnes of maize, and two trucks full of 1,000 blankets, 1,000 tents, rice, bed nets and milk for the flood victims in Kilosa.The Government has been forced to step up efforts to evict people from dangerous areas as some have been reluctant to leave their houses, despite the danger of being swept by the floods.The Morogoro regional commissioner, Mr Issa Machibya, announced that a decision was reached to temporarily turn all ward secondary schools into relief centres to accommodate and assist the victims.He had told our reporter in Kilosa that the regional administration had dispatched some assistance to the flood victims"" December 28, 2009: ""Heavy rains that pounded Dodoma and Morogoro regions during Christmas holidays left thousands of people homeless.The rains began on Christmas Day, and continued well into Boxing Day, bringing misery to hundreds of families in Kongwa and Kilosa districts in Dodoma and Morogoro regions, respectively.Thousands of people were forced to seek shelter elsewhere after their house were either swept away or flooded after a downpour lasting several hours.Flooding in Kongwa killed at least one person, whose body was found floating in a swollen river on Saturday. The body had not been identified by midday yesterday.District officials yesterday confirmed that 14 houses had been washed away in one village alone.Kongwa District Commissioner Lembris Kipuyo said at least 12 families had been given temporary shelter by the district administration after their house were either destroyed or badly damaged in the downpour.He said the decision to evacuate the residents was reached during an emergency meeting of the district disaster committee.""These people had no roofs over their heads after their houses were either washed away or damaged to the extent of being uninhabitable they have been offered temporary shelter elsewhere,""he said.Mr Kipuyo said large areas were under water, and the belongings of those who fled their homes could be seen floating on the floodwaters.The district disaster committee in collaboration with Red Cross Tanzania had since Saturday been busy providing the evacuees with relief supplies, including food and mosquito nets.""We have also supplied them with anti-malaria drugs and water treatment chemicals to prevent an outbreak of malaria and water-borne diseases,"" Mr Kipuyo said.In Kilosa, over 10 houses were swept away and at least 500 others flooded by a relentless downpour.The situation worsened after the swollen River Mkondo burst its banks, causing torrents of water to gush into human settlements.Kilosa District Council executive officer Ephraim Kalimalwendo said roads and other infrastructures were likely to suffer major damage as a result of the floods.He said the level of River Mkondo had risen by almost a metre due to heavy rains in catchment areas in Dodoma Region, adding that the situation was likely to get worse before it got any better.Mr Kalimalwendo said, however, that there were no reports of loss of life, adding that his office was working to establish the extent of the damage.Meanwhile, people displaced by the floods appealed for humanitarian assistance from the government.They also called for the speedy construction of the proposed Kidete Dam to prevent flooding in the area.Mr Kalimalwendo said district authorities were finalising plans to award a tender for the construction of the dam. The project was initiated by area MP Mustafa Mkulo, who is also the Finance and Economic Affairs minister.Morogoro Regional Commissioner Issa Machibya visited the victims and consoled them. He said the government would work closely with local authorities to extend assistance where necessary.""We have already been in touch with the Tanzania People's Defence Forces, who have agreed to supply tents to those whose houses have been destroyed. The Red Cross will also assist in the humanitarian effort,"" he said.Early last week, flash floods swept several bridges and culverts along the Babati-Arusha highway, paralysing transport.For nearly 36 hours from Tuesday midnight the road was rendered impassable to motorised traffic.It was not until around 11am on Wednesday that all types of vehicles were cleared to move on after restoration of the road network by the Chinese engineers constructing the Minjingu-Babati portion of the highway.At Mawe Maro, the entire lowland was flooded following torrential rains. At Matufa the road stretch was covered by mud, sand and debris from the adjacent hills.According to the Tanzania Meteorological Agency (TMA), Babati station registered 50mm of rain on Tuesday, the highest recorded in the country for the day.The rains paralysed transport between Arusha and Babati as well as to the central and Lake Zone regions.Buses heading to Arusha on Wednesday from Manyara, Dodoma, Singida and western regions could not make it to the tourist town until midnight or early Thursday."

""ember 22, 2009: ""Clean-up efforts are underway in flood-hit towns following the heaviest downpours ever recorded in England, as fears mount for a woman missing near a swollen river in Wales.About 314mm of rain fell in 24 hours - the highest level since records began - over Cumbria as torrential rains swept across Britain and Ireland.The Environment Agency said 65 flood warnings are in force across England and Wales, with four severe warnings in Cumbria in northwest England, the area hardest hit.About 60 people were still sheltering in reception centres on Sunday and more than 700 properties remained without power.An urgent safety review of Cumbria's 1,800 bridges was underway, with emergency services warning one bridge in the coastal town of Workington could collapse at any time.The Calva Bridge's closure cut off the north side of the town.Workington's other bridge has collapsed, taking the life of a policeman who was diverting motorists away from it on Friday.Tony Cunningham, member of parliament for Workington, said: ""We have concerns about people who have not got prescriptions, medication, the medical centre is down to its last nappies for babies.The floods in Cumbria and southern Scotland are expected to trigger insurance claims of up to STG100 million ($A181.21 million), the Association of British Insurers said.Meanwhile a search is underway for a woman believed to have been swept away by the River Usk in Brecon, south Wales, late on Saturday. The river is under flood watch.Prime Minister Gordon Brown surveyed the grim aftermath on a visit on Saturday to the badly hit Cumbria town of Cockermouth, with houses filled with muddy water, silt and sludge carpeting the roads and cars left awkwardly where the floods left them.Cockermouth town centre was cordoned off as surveyors, structural engineers, utility workers and Environment Agency staff continued work to start the clean-up."" ...""Ireland battled floods on Saturday described as a ""once in 800 years event"", with the government rushing to provide shelter and drinking water and soldiers sent to assist those affected. Rivers burst their banks, coastal towns were threatened by sea flooding, 18,000 households were left without water in Cork, Ireland's second city -- and forecasters warned of more heavy rain to come.""We have been told this is a once in 800 years event. We have had no fatalities and that is a blessing,"" Environment Minister John Gormley told RTE state radio as he toured some of the worst hit areas.Prime Minister Brian Cowen chaired a meeting of the national emergency coordination committee, and said the main concern was to help people evacuated from their homes and to maintain water supplies.""Clearly we are very concerned about maintaining the priority of helping those who have been displaced or have to be looked after in accommodation. Also making sure that people have access to clean drinking water,"" he said.""There is also a situation where major installations have to be protected, hospitals for example.""Troops were drafted in to assist emergency services in the worst hit areas, particularly Cork in the south and towns in the south, midlands and west of the republic, as forecasters predicted more heavy rain to come.In Cork where the River Lee burst its banks, RTE reported that 18,000 homes had their water cut off following extensive damage to the city's main pumping station, and said it was unlikely to be restored for at least a week....In Galway to the west, local authorities warned flood waters were still rising and urged motorists to avoid travelling, amid widespread road closures.Thousands of hectares of farmland were submerged and the Irish Farmers Association warned of severe economic repercussions.The Meteorological Office has issued a weather alert and warned of severe gales. It said its stations at Sherkin Island, County Cork and Claremorris, County Mayo in the west have already had more rain than in any previous full November. Meteorologist Gerry Fleming added: ""The run of wet summers and wet winters we been having in the last two years are unprecedented."" November 20, 2009: ""Parts of Scotland and northern England were under several feet of water Friday morning after raging rivers burst their banks and flooded towns, officials said.A police officer was missing after flooding in Cumbria, near the border with Scotland, Cumbria police said Friday. An earlier report that 11 people were missing was incorrect, a police spokesman said.The Cumbria town of Cockermouth was one of the worst hit. The Georgian market town sits at the junction of two rivers, the Cocker and the Derwent, which raged overnight and flooded the town center.The waters were so strong at times that rescuers could not send their boats against the flow to reach trapped residents, witnesses said.Two bridges in Workington, about seven miles east of Cockermouth, collapsed because of the floods, Cumbria police said. Engineers are trying to assess bridges for structural damage, though the work is difficult while the waters remain high, police said.Witnesses said the nearby town of Keswick, about 10 miles to the southeast of Cockermouth, was also badly hit.The Fire Service and Royal Air Force evacuated about 200 people by helicopter from Cockermouth's main street and town square, both cut off by the floodwaters, Cumbria police said.Police advised against all non-essential travel in Cumbria because many roads are closed and impassable.Several reception centers were set up at schools and leisure centers for residents forced from their homes, the police said.British Prime Minister Gordon Brown spoke with Cumbria's chief constable Friday morning and promised him any government help he needs, Brown's office at Downing Street said.""His thoughts are with all those who have been impacted by the floods and our thanks go to the emergency services, who continue their extraordinary efforts to help those affected,"" a statement from his office said.Environment Secretary Hilary Benn was in Cumbria on Friday to assess a government response, Downing Street said.There were no deaths reported from the floods, which began Thursday after heavy rain swept over the region.One of the largest recorded totals was in Seathwaite, about 20 miles south of Cockermouth, known for being one of the wettest places in the United Kingdom. About 14.6 inches (372 millimeters) of rain fell there between Wednesday night and 4 a.m. Friday (11 p.m. ET Thursday), said forecaster Robin Thwaytes of the Met Office weather service.""It's a phenomenal amount of rain to come down in such a short period of time,"" he said.Bad weather was forecast to continue across the United Kingdom over the next few days, with more heavy rain and gale-force winds bringing the continued risk of flooding, the Met Office said...""Raging floods engulfed northern England's picturesque Lake District on Friday following the heaviest rainfall ever recorded in Britain, killing a police officer and trapping dozens in their swamped homes.Military helicopters winched dozens of people to safety and emergency workers in bright orange inflatable boats rescued scores more after an unprecedented deluge.British soldiers conducted house-to-house searches for those trapped by floods as deep as 8 feet (2.5 meters). Troops also dropped down on lines from Royal Air Force helicopters, breaking through rooftops to pluck people to safety.Constable Bill Barker, 44, died as he joined rescue attempts, swept into the surging waters when a major bridge collapsed. Emergency services said more than 200 people were rescued in the hardest-hit town, Cockermouth and about 1,000 homes were flooded.In a message to local officials, Queen Elizabeth II said she was ""deeply concerned and saddened by the dreadful flooding across Britain.""

""We are all in the open now with very little help. We don't have much so we have to give first to the weakest.""A lot of livestock have reportedly died due to the ongoing rains. ""Hundreds of goats and sheep weakened by the drought have succumbed to the rains and the cold weather,"" said Ali Hassan, a civil society activist.He said El-Waq, like the rest of Somalia, was waiting for the rain but it was ""too much in too short a time. If the rain continues the way it has for the last four days we will be in serious trouble.""He said most of the residents, about 18,000 with some 900 displaced families (5,400 people) from Mogadishu, had been affected. ""We are no better than the displaced today,"" he added. He said the population was concentrating on the hills around the town. ""Any higher ground in the area is now occupied.""Hassan Hussein, an engineer with Development Frontier International, an NGO, told IRIN they were now trying to dig trenches to allow the water to drain from the town.He said there was still a danger of more flooding since the rains were ongoing. He said his group was organizing the population to alert them to any more danger. ""We are using the loud-speakers in mosques to tell people to help the weak and to get to higher ground.""People who are still in low-lying areas were also being told to move to higher ground, he said.He said shelter material was urgently needed. ""There are many people who are too weak to stay in the open or in the flimsy shelters we have.

Many have already sought alternative shelter, with some heading to a camp for the displaced along the Malindi-Garissa highway.John Manasseh, a local leader, told IRIN on 28 October: ""We had assumed that since the rains were delayed at the beginning of the year, we would not experience any flooding. We even started cultivating our farms in readiness for the rain, but it seems we were all wrong.""Most of the coastal region has been dry, having not had rains since early 2009. In August, the Kenya Meteorological Department warned that the country could soon experience El Ni?o-related enhanced rainfall. Already, heavy rains have been reported in many parts of the country, with Coast Province being the latest to experience flooding.The Magarini flash floods occurred a day after two people reportedly died in Kolongoni village in neighbouring Kilifi district, after a house in which they were sleeping collapsed after a downpour, crushing them.Jillo Galgalo, one of those displaced by the floods in Magarini, said they lacked clean water for domestic use and were at risk of infection from waterborne diseases.""Most pit latrines have been washed away because nobody expected any floods to occur this soon,"" Galgalo said. ""We are in dire need of clean water because most water points are now filled with all sorts of waste, including human waste and cow dung.""Along with the neighbouring Tana River district - where roads connecting the towns of Mombasa, Garissa and Lamu have been cut off due to the rains - roads in Kilifi have not been spared, with most roads connecting local trading centres impassable"" October 28, 2009: ""Nairobi ¡ª Three districts were yesterday morning cut off from Mombasa after El-Nino rains washed away a section of the Mombasa-Lamu highway.The damaged Kinagoni bridge puts the lives of more than 200,000 people in Lamu, Tana Delta and Tana River at risk of not getting food and other supplies from Mombasa and Malindi.Over 2,000 people were rendered homeless when more than 500 homesteads were submerged by water between Malindi and Garsen.A 500 metre stretch of the road was extensively damaged and will require total reconstruction, Magarini DC Peter Karanja said at the scene of the damaged bridge.A man who tried to cross the seasonal river shortly after the bridge was damaged was swept away by the floods and was believed to have drowned, although rescuers had not yet recovered his body, Mr Karanja said. Travelers from both sides of the road were stranded as buses turned back when they reached the section of the road"".October 25, 2009 ""Experts estimate that the situation is not currently as bad as the El Ni?o floods of 1997 that put much of eastern Kenya under water, but the short rains are expected to last until December or longer so conditions in both Somalia and Kenya are likely to deteriorate further.The United Nations currently estimates that a total of up to 1.8 million people are affected by the floods in Kenya, Somalia and Ethiopia.In addition to the life-threatening rising waters, cholera outbreaks have been reported and the toll from diseases such as malaria is expected to rise.The floods followed a regional drought earlier this year that killed large numbers of livestock and left millions of nomadic herders reliant on food aid and other assistance even after the rains.""

The World Health Organisation says 1.43 million people, mostly in and around Manila, continue to endure a dangerous existence living in flooded districts.Those areas may remain flooded for months because chaotic urban planning has led to natural drainage systems along lakes being blocked. Already 175 people have died in those areas from leptospirosis, a bacterial disease that is contracted from contact with flood waters contaminated with rat and cat urine.""The solution is to get them out of these places,"" Art Pesigan, an official with the WHO's emergency and humanitarian action unit, told AFP, referring to those living in the flood waters. Another 163,000 people who lost their homes in the disasters remain in evacuation centres, according to the government, with few options but to stay there and rely on handouts.The government, which has repeatedly said it is not able to cope with the twin disasters on its own, has appealed for international help. But although foreign governments and international aid agencies have provided crucial aid, less than a third of a UN appeal for $74 million has been raised.Amid the immediate relief concerns, the government is also having to grapple with longer-term reconstruction efforts. One of the main concerns is that too many people, particularly slum dwellers, in Manila have been allowed to live in flood-prone areas.A government report last week called for 2.7 million people in shantytowns to be moved from ""danger zones"" alongside riverbanks, lakes and sewers. The plan would affect one in five Manila residents and take 10 years and P130 billion ($2.77 billion) to implement. Economic migrants who flocked Manila's teeming shantytowns are being offered free bus fares back to their abandoned farms.October 18, 2009: ""The death toll from two devastating storms that struck the Philippines over the past month has risen to 858, with ensuing disease outbreaks killing 89 others, the government said Monday.The latest National Disaster Coordinating Council toll is up from 818 on Sunday.It said Tropical Storm Ketsana left 420 dead and 37 missing when it flooded 80 percent of Manila on September 26, a disaster the government said affected 4.35 million people.Some areas are still flooded three weeks later and 189,000 people remain in evacuation centres, it added.Typhoon Parma hit the northern Philippines on October 3 and lingered as a tropical storm for a week, triggering landslides that killed 438 people and leaving 51 missing mostly in mountain communities.The government agency said Parma affected 4.16 million people, including more than 32,000 who remain at evacuation centres.The health department said leptospirosis, a bacterial disease that can lead to kidney failure and is caused by exposure to animal urine in flood waters, later killed at least 89 people.""October 18, 2009: ""Massive floods brought by powerful storms have caused an outbreak of the deadly disease leptospirosis that has claimed 89 lives in the Philippine capital alone, the health secretary said Saturday.The incidence of the disease in the Philippine capital and surrounding areas rose to 1,027 with 89 fatalities from October 1-15 this year compared to 769 cases and only 39 deaths in the same period last year, Secretary Francis Duque said.""It is largely attributable to the floods,"" Duque told AFP.Huge floods covered parts of Manila and its surrounding areas after tropical storm Ketsana hit the country on September 26.This was compounded by typhoon Parma which hit a few days later, again bringing heavy rains. In some areas, the floodwaters have not receded.This has caused many people to fall ill of leptospirosis, an infectious disease caused by exposure to dirty, stagnant water.To lessen the incidence of the disease, Duque said authorities had declared an outbreak of the disease in three districts of the capital and were administering antibiotics to some 1.3 million people.""It will provide substantial protection,"" he said.

"8/13/09: ""Four days after Taiwans worst floods in half a century  just as the residents of Taoyuan believed Typhoon Morakots violence was finally over  a terrifying order came through from the military: run  youve got minutes to live.Grabbing whatever food and possessions they could, the 500 villagers began a panicked scramble to the higher ground, heaving themselves over jagged rocks and clambering over walls of mud.Within moments of the last stragglers reaching safety, a giant flood lake formed by Sundays mudslides broke its banks, unleashing what eye-witnesses called a mountain tsunami.The incident in Taoyuan was just one of many chaotic scenes played out across southern Taiwan today amid more torrential rain and fears of a dramatic rise in the death toll.Many villages and small mountain communities remain inaccessible  a series of medicine and food airdrops today suggested that it may be days before many of those left homeless by Morakot are reconnected with the outside world. Some had scrawled giant SOS messages on bits of broken timber ¡ª one or two with estimates of the number of dead beneath the mudslides.Added to the misery has been mounting condemnation of the handling of the disaster by the authorities. Newspaper editorials accused Taiwan¡¯s president, Ma Ying-jeou of being incompetent, and carried reports of survivors digging, unaided, in search of loved ones. One survivor said: ¡°We are forgo"".¡±Much of the anger is directed at the Government¡¯s failure to seek foreign assistance from countries such as Japan or the United States, a reluctance thought to be born of stubborn pride.Mr Ma's inspection of the relief efforts was interrupted when he was surrounded by a group of enraged survivors. ¡°What is your Government doing?¡± one man shouted at the President. ¡°It¡¯s too late, they cannot be saved.¡±Thousands have been found alive in remote mountain villages ¡ª including another group of 300 discovered stranded this morning ¡ª but reaching them is difficult. Even helicopter airlifts have been hampered by the bad weather, with the number of evacuations lower than expected.Estimates vary wildly over how many people might still be alive, and, more grimly, how many may lie crushed under thousands of tonnes of collapsed mountainside. The official toll stands at 108, though there is a strong suspicion among rescue workers that the figure could triple as the search goes on.The G""sent another 4,000 troops to join the 16,000 already deployed throughout the flood-stricken disaster zone. Liao Liao-yi, the Interior Minister, spent the day denying suggestions that the relief effort had been lacklustre, assuring reporters that the pace had picked up from yesterday.To those waiting at the heliports on the edge of the disaster zone, however, progress again felt painfully slow. Bridges have been obliterated and many roads have either been buried under landslides or smashed off the mountains. In the area around Taoyuan, the authorities warned that other flood-lakes could burst at any moment.None of this has calmed the anger of the villagers waiting impatiently for news of their families. Many in the worst-hit area of Kaohsiung county believe that the south, which is the main stronghold of the opposition party, is being deliberately starved of assistance.¡°It¡¯s too slow.

"July 16: ""The floods that devastated portions of north Moravia will have a significant effect on the Czech economy over the course of 2009 as billions of crowns in government funds go to environmental and infrastructure recovery, forcing the government to reconsider its previously approved budget, said Finance Minister Eduard Janota.Heavy rainstorms took the north Moravian regions and Olomouc by surprise in the last week of June, killing 13 and leaving vast stretches of roadways and villages underwater in the worst natural disaster in the country since the floods that killed 17 in 2002. The long aftermath of flood recovery will take a heavy toll as well, costing at least 5 billion K?

Minor flooding also hit at least nine other communities. The floods resulted from a rare combination of unusually heavy winter snow and a spring warm-up over the past week that saw temperatures soar into the 70s -- a good 20 degrees higher than normal for this time of year. National Weather Service forecasters said temperatures have dropped to seasonably cool levels and are likely to stay that way for the next week or so, which they say could ease some of the flooding.One of the hardest-hit waterways has been the Yukon River. At 2,300 miles long, it is Alaska's lengthiest river. Melting snow in the Yukon's Canadian headwaters poured more water than normal into the river. At the same time, the warmer temperatures caused giant chunks of ice to break up and form a massive jam just upstream from the communities of Eagle (population about 140) and Eagle Village (population about 70), said Robin Radlein, a regional hydrologist for the weather service in Anchorage."""
"May 18: TRIZIDELA DO VALE, Brazil  Swelled rivers that have flooded homes to their rooftops and forced more than 260,000 people from their homes in northeastern Brazil will probably take a few more weeks to recede, Brazilian authorities said over the weekend.The intense flooding has paralyzed large swaths of this sweltering tropical region, where schools and government buildings have been closed for weeks and whole towns are almost underwater. While water levels have receded somewhat in recent days, showers continued through the weekend. That further complicated the timeline for the drenched areas to dry out and for residents to return to their homes. With only marginal assistance arriving from the federal government, local authorities in some of Brazils poorest states say they are at the breaking point. The water level is not dropping fast enough, said Jânio de Sousa Freitas, the mayor of Trizidela do Vale, one of the worst-hit towns. We are facing a critical situation. We dont have the resources to cope with the heavy demand for basic goods, from food to medicines to mattresses.¡±The flooding, which began in April, has been the third-worst in the past 49 years, based on the amount of rainfall in a single month, said Lincoln Muniz Alves, a climatologist in S?o Paulo for the Center for Weather Fo""casting and Climate Studies.It is the second time in six months that intense flooding has turned into a regional disaster. In November, torrential rains in Santa Catarina, in the south, caused landslides that left 135 people dead and swept more than 78,000 from their homes, affecting some 60 towns.¡°What we are observing in the last few years in Brazil is a pattern of droughts and more intense rains,¡± said Carlos Nobre, a climatologist in S?o Paulo at the National Institute of Space Research.Colder temperatures in the Pacific Ocean, which climatologists have called the La Ni?a effect, are colliding with warmer temperatures in the tropical southern Atlantic Ocean, one possible explanation for the extreme weather patterns, he said.Heavy rains continue to force more people from their homes. Civil-defense authorities said Sunday that the number of homeless or displaced people in the state of Maranh?o had climbed beyond 116,000, with 10 dead and 93 towns in a state of emergency. ""ay 14:Thousands of Brazilians returned home yesterday following devastating floods but water kept on rising in some places and civil defence officials used helicopters, trucks and boats to deliver aid to victims in isolated communities.The death toll dropped from 42 to 39. The number of homeless decreased from 300,000 to 267,000 as residents headed home in some of the 11 states affected by the floods - an area more than five times the size of New Zealand. But waters were still rising in some places and authorities warned that the situation remained a threat because the weather forecast calls for more downpours.A major aid effort was still under way, with civil defence officials delivering food and drinking water to isolated communities surrounded by muddy water and newly formed lakes.Flood victims gathered around helicopters dropping off aid in the hard-hit state of Maranhao, and Globo TV showed images of people living on the roofs of homes inundated with water because they feared looters would strike if they headed to shelters.Rain was still falling in some parts of the zone stretching from the Amazon to normally dry northeastern Brazil, which has experienced its worst flooding in at least two decades. Meteorologists have blamed the rainfall that led to the floods on an Atlantic Ocean weather system that usually moves on in March but didn't budge this year.Water was still rising yesterday in sprawling Amazonas state, and low-lying parts of the jungle city of Manaus were flooding as the mighty Rio Negro river that feeds the Amazon approached a record set in 1953.""
